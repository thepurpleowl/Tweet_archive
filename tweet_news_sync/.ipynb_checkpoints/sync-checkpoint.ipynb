      "Gorakhnath head priest to shift to 5, Kalidas Marg, Lucknow Yogi Adityanath Shares 1 Amita Shah  50am , New Delhi , DNA \n",
      "Always in saffron robes, the politician and priest Yogi Adityanath has been flitting between Parliament and the Gorakhnath Mutt for nearly two decades. \n",
      "At 44, the youngest MP to win five terms, the Gorakhpur MP has a new mission before him — managing the reins of the most populous state in the country — along with two deputies, Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma. \n",
      "For the fiery hardliner, Hindutva has been at the core of his political and spiritual life. The BJP leadership, in naming him as the next chief minister, has underlined the party's Hindutva agenda, sparking off speculation of the Ram Temple issue being re-ignited, ahead of the 2019 elections. \n",
      "In 2014, when he won from Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat for the fifth consecutive time, he had set ensuring BJP's victory in 2017 assembly polls as his priority. At that time, he had said he did not have any personal ambitions. \n",
      "Just two years later, Adityanath is making his journey to Lucknow from the Gorakhnath Mutt, where he has been the head priest for three years. At the mutt, where the walls of his office, a 70-year-old building, have images of Gods and Buddha, he would hold a janata durbar for an hour every morning. On one side, his staff sat on the floor drafting on typewriters' complaints, that ranged from problems in colleges to property disputes in families. \n",
      "Around a thousand letters were typed in a day. \n",
      "Those close to him said his day would begin at 3.30 am and he would first take a round of the temple and the gaushala, before setting off on his campaign. People in Gorakhpur said he did not campaign just ahead of elections but fought all through the year. \n",
      "Originally a Thakur from Uttarakhand, who was named Ajay Bisht, he took sanyas at 23. Incidentally, Adityanath too is from Pauri, like the new Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Rawat. While the controversial Adityanath was a firebrand Hindutva hardliner, who had made a mark for himself in eastern UP's Gorakhpur, Maurya, who was made the BJP's state chief, was an OBC leader who came from the VHP. Meanwhile, Dinesh Sharma, is a Brahmin. Though the BJP got the support of large sections of backward castes, its choice of CM indicated the party's efforts at consolidating the majority vote cutting across caste lines. \n",
      "After Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Adityanath was the most sought-after leader in the run-up to the election, which the BJP swept winning 312 seats. It is said that his keeping away from groupism also went to his advantage in the selection of chief minister. \n",

      "The last-minute choice of Yogi Adityanath, after hectic parleys for a week in Delhi and Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, where the RSS national conclave is set to begin on Sunday, is seen in UP political circles as the resurfacing of differences between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS). \n",
      "Frustration and dissatisfaction loomed large on the faces of party MLAs when they came out of Lok Bhawan, the new Secretariat of the 32nd Chief Minister, after the BJP legislature party meeting on Saturday evening. \n",
      "While the media was agog with speculation that Manoj Sinha, Union Minister of State for Railways, reportedly the choice of Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah, would become the chief minister after 14 years of party 'vanvaas' in UP, temperature suddenly soared at the party headquarters in Lucknow when Adityanath and Maurya were called to Delhi. \n",
      "After meeting Shah, both Adityanath and Maurya returned from New Delhi late afternoon. They separately met Naidu at the VVIP Guest House and then moved to Lok Bhawan to attend the legislature party meeting. \"The meeting was just a formality to endorse their names, which were already decided by the party high command,\" claimed another MLA. \n",
      "The question doing the rounds in Lucknow is that after winning with such a huge mandate, how did Modi and Shah succumbed to the Sangh Parivar's pressure? The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) had already declared Adityanath as the choice of the saffron outfits. Observers claim that the last-minute choice of Adityanath seems to have affected Modi's position within the saffron brigade. \n",
      "They also suggest that it may imply that after getting a huge mandate, the BJP seems to be planning to come back to its aggressive Hindutva and Ram temple agenda in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. \"It is too early to predict but Adityanath's election or rather nomination is a pointer to this assertion,\" points RM Lal, a senior journalist. \n",
      "Those who know the new chief minister well fear that once at the helm of power, he is going to be unstoppable. It is that fear which led the party high command to appoint two deputy chief ministers to keep the hardliner under control. Yogi's appointment seems to have made hollow the party's poll promise 'sabka saath sabka vikas' as minority community leaders have taken this decision with a pinch of salt. \n",
      "\"How will we live without fear and expect that the new government will carry out development for the community members when its head is a man who has been openly advocating declaration of India as a Hindu Rashtra and has been spitting venom against the minority community in almost all his public meetings?\" fumes Mohammed Usman, an influential community leader from old Lucknow. \n",

      "LUCKNOW: After a week of encouraging speculation about several names with 'development' credentials, Narendra Modi chose as the next Uttar Pradesh chief minister a 44-year-old man who wears saffron clothes and Ray Ban glasses and frequently makes attention-getting statements. \n",
      "Yogi Adityanath is fondly called a firebrand leader by those of right-wing persuasion and a Hindutva fanatic by critics on the left. As the Mahant of Gorakhnath Math, he has some heft in eastern Uttar Pradesh and considerable support among the 312 BJP MLAs in the state. \n",
      "While he will represent the hard right at the apex of the BJP government in UP, he will be leavened with two softies who will be deputies to him, Keshav Maurya, the party chief for UP, and Dinesh Sharma, a doctor and mayor of Lucknow. \n",
      "The swearing-in ceremony will take place on Sunday. \n",
      "Before arriving at Yogi Adityanath’s name for chief minister, the BJP high command had put it about that it was considering several names: Rajnath Singh, Keshav Maurya, Dinesh Sharma and Manoj Sinha. The last-named helped the feint along by visiting the Kaal Bhairav temple and Sankat Mochan temples in Varanasi on Saturday and mouthing coy quotes about the conquest of desire, both of which served to whet the media appetite. \n",
      "When it was finally declared, pundits scurried to make meaning of it, trying to square up the development-centred Brand Modi and the Hindutva-orientied Brand Yogi. One analyst said this was a signal that the high command has read its electoral mandate as the green signal to go the whole hog with its saffron agenda, no apologies thank you. \"Had the party been restricted to 200 or so seats, it would certainly have gone for a moderate choice,\" said the political analyst. \n",
      "While the victory in UP was unquestionably a Modi conquest, the Yogi did play a key role in effecting a reverse consolidation of the majority vote behind the BJP in an election in which the party’s rivals were busy wooing the minorities. The saffron-clad commissar holds sway over some 65 seats across 10 districts in the east and has been a five-time MP from Gorakhpur, having won his 2014 election by a staggering three lakh votes. \n",
      "While being a nod to hard Hindutva, Adityanath’s appointment would be key to Narendra Modi’s design of giving a development edge to his UP strategy. Eastern UP, or Purvanchal, is considered to be a backward region of UP, and the PM’s own constituency of Varanasi falls in it. The BJP bagged all the Lok Sabha seats here bar Azamgarh in 2014 and swept it up in the recent state election except stray pockets. So it seems logical that the CM be from Purvanchal. \n",
      "While popular attention was trained on the Prime Minister during the final days of the recent election campaign, Yogi Adityanath was quite the star campaigner. He addressed as many rallies across the state as Amit Shah and was even sent to Mumbai to mobilise voters for the BJP in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections. \n",
      "Crucially perhaps, the Mahant of Gorakhnath Peeth is close to the RSS and as the founder of the Hindu Yuva Vahini worked up some fervor among the youth in his home bastions. His appointment to the chief minister’s chair was whispered about even before the elections, and that must have been the thing the BJP high command’s observers were harking back to when they said at the end of the day, “We always thought he was the leader.” Related Article \n",

      "LUCKNOW: Priest-turned politician Yogi Adityanath, the controversial mascot of hardline Hindutva, was today named as next Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, in a move by the BJP that took many by surprise. \n",
      "Ending the suspense exactly a week after BJP won a three- fourths majority in the key Hindi heartland state and stormed back to power after 15 years, the 44-year-old five-term MP from Gorakhpur was unanimously elected the BJP legislature party leader at a meeting of the newly elected MLAs. \n",
      "Adityanath will be sworn in on sunday at a ceremony at Kanshiram Smriti Upvan here at 2.15 PM where Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah will be present. \n",
      "State BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya, who was himself in contention for the top job besides union minister Manoj Sinha, first announced Adityanath's election amid speculation that the RSS pushed for Yogi's candidature. \n",
      "Maurya, the MP from Phulpur in Allahabad, will be the deputy chief minister apart from senior BJP leader and Lucknow Mayor Dinesh Sharma. \n",
      "Adityanath, who lacks administrative experience, will be the 21st chief minister of UP and the fourth from the saffron party. \n",
      "After his election, Adityanath met Governor Ram Naik and said he was invited to form the government in UP. \n",
      "He said he would follow Prime Minister Modi's slogan \"sab ka saath, sab ka vikas\" and ensure all round development of the the country's most populous state. \n",
      "\"I am confident that the state will march on the path of development,\" he said in his first brief media interaction at the Raj Bhawan. \n",
      "The Yogi said his efforts would be to provide \"good governance\" in the state. Adityanath has several criminal cases against him. He has been charged in the past with rioting, attempt to murder, armed with deadly weapon, endangering life or personal safety of others, unlawful assembly, trespassing on burial places and criminal intimidation. \n",
      "A murder case is going on in the court of CJM, Maharajganj, according to his 2014 election affidavit. \n",
      "He is not known to enjoy good rapport with the BJP leadership and his elevation has left many puzzled, with political circles abuzz with talk of RSS having prevailed over the party in deciding the new chief minister. \n",
      "Often caught in controversy because of his speeches, Adityanath allegedly led a \"purification\" drive for conversion of Christians to Hinduism in 2005. \n",
      "In 2015, he reportedly said those who oppose yoga can leave India and that they should all be drowned. \n",
      "He was arrested for allegedly inciting Gorakhpur riots in 2007. \n",
      "Adityanath, considered a divisive political figure, enjoys considerable popularity in the state and is known to make provocative statements, be it about Islam or Pakistan. \n",
      "A strong votary of construction of the Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, Adityanath drove BJP's Hindutva campaign in the eastern UP in the just concluded Assembly polls. \n",
      "Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, who along with BJP general secretary Bhupendra Yadav was present at the meeting as central observer for the election, told a press conference that Adityanath's name was proposed by Suresh Khanna, an 8- term MLA, and seconded by 10 others. \n",
      "Naidu said even after the proposal was made, he asked the 312 newly elected MLAs if they wanted to propose anybody else for the post, but they all backed Adityanath unanimously. \n",
      "Naidu said that the Yogi then said he needed two deputy CMs to assist him in the gigantic task, following which it was decided that Maurya and Sharma would hold the posts. \n",
      "As the meeting was about to begin, an element of surprise gripped the venue when Adityanath reached Lok Bhawan opposite the imposing Assembly complex. \n",
      "Midway through the meeting, Sharma was asked to attend the deliberations. Interestingly, none of the three is a legislator in UP. \n",
      "As soon as it was decided that the saffron-robed Gorakhpur MP will hold the reins of the state that raised eyebrows, party leaders and MLAs rushed to the dais with sweets and garlands. \n",

      "National news #YogiAdityanath: 10 things to know about UP's new chief minister It's Yogi Adityanath. The week-long suspense over who will be the next chief minister of Uttar Pradesh finally got over following an announcement by the BJP. It's Yogi Adityanath. The week-long suspense over who will be the next chief minister of Uttar Pradesh finally got over following an announcement by the BJP. The new chief minister and his new cabinet will take oath on Sunday. The announcement came following intense drama on Saturday even as sources claimed MoS for Railways Manoj Sinha was \"almost\" certain to be the chief minister. But there was no clarity as the BJP top brass remained tightlipped over the decision following reports of a tussle with the party's ideological mentor, RSS. The RSS reportedly wasn't too happy with Sinha as the CM candidate. Sinha was reportedly the original choice for CM and was backed by PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah. Adityanath allegedly led a 'purification' drive for conversion of Christians to Hinduism in 2005. Photo: PTI The suspense grew after the Gorakhpur MP Adityanath was flown to Delhi to meet BJP president Amit Shah, which was followed by a formal announcement later in the evening. Here are 10 things to know about the new chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. 1. Born on June 5, 1972, Yogi Adityanath's real name is Ajay Singh. He has a BSc degree from HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar, Uttarakhand. 2. He was elected as the member of the 12th Lok Sabha in 1998 from Gorakhpur constituency, becoming the youngest MP at the age of 26. He has so far been MP from the same constituency five times. 3. Known for his firebrand politics, Adityanath never had to rely on Modi wave to cling on to his seat or get anointed as the Uttar Pradesh CM. A fact that proves his immense popularity among the electorate is the margin of 1, 42,309 votes with which he won the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. 4. Adityanath has several criminal cases against him. But that didn’t stop him from becoming the CM of the most populous and communally sensitive Uttar Pradesh. He has been charged in the past with rioting, attempt to murder, armed with deadly weapon, endangering life or personal safety of others, unlawful assembly, trespassing on burial places and criminal intimidation. 5. Often caught in controversy because of his speeches, Adityanath allegedly led a “purification” drive for conversion of Christians to Hinduism in 2005. In 2015, he reportedly said those who oppose yoga can leave India and that they should all be drowned. 6. He was arrested for inciting Gorakhpur riots in 2007. In Gorakhpur riots of 2007, a Hindu boy was killed after some people opened fire on a Muslim procession that took place on the occasion of Moharam. When the youth succumbed to the injuries and died, Yogi Adityanath allegedly vowed to deliver justice to Hindus. He announced a torchlight procession and a “Shraddhanjali Sabha (pay homage)”. 7. Adityanath is the founder of the Hindu Yuva Vahini - a “social, cultural and nationalist group” of young people. Known for his impeccable Hindutva credentials that includes support for Ghar Wapsi and fight against “Love Jihad”, Adityanath’s Hindu Yuva Vahini in 2015 embarked on a mission to declare the cow as “rashtra maata” (mother of the nation). The Hindu Yuva Vahini even launched a missed-call subscription initiative on a pilot basis in Aligarh to canvass support for the cause. 8. In the run-up to Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, he said the alleged exodus of Hindus from Kairana and “Love Jihad” were important issues for the BJP. The new UP chief minister is a strong proponent of the \"anti-Romeo squads\". He has been saying that the squad will work towards restoring the pride of women. \"There are areas in western UP where girls can't go to school. The squad will work for their rights and ensure safety of women in the state,\" he had said earlier. 9. He, however, has had a strained relationship with the BJP for more than a decade. The troubled relationship was finally normalised with the RSS's intervention. 10. With his anointment as Uttar Pradesh CM, Adityanath joined the famous league of BJP’s bachelor CMs – Trivendra Rawat (Uttarakhand), ML Khattar (Haryana), Sarbananda Sonowal (Assam).\n",

      "Congress, SP react with caution as BJP defends pick Mar 19, 2017, 06.59AM IST TNN NEW DELHI: Soon after Yogi Aditynath was chosen the Uttar Pradesh CM, Congress member Veerappa Moily called it the \"biggest assault\" on secularism, a remark promptly dismissed by BJP, which said the MP stood for development, \"as reflected in his election to the Lok Sabha five times\".\"Maybe, BJP or RSS would like to endorse their cause of Hinduism. India is not Hinduism. Hinduism is not India... Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) is the very foundation of our secular society,\" Moily said. Congress' official reaction though was a bit cautious with party spokesman Randeep Surjewala saying, \"Congress will continue to act as watchdog of people's interests and play a constructive role in progress of UP.\" Maintaining that the prerogative of choosing a CM rested with the ruling party, he said, \"The excessive delay in arriving at a decision as also the compulsion to create two posts of deputy CMs reflects a bitter conflict to share spoils of power despite overwhelming majority of over 300 MLAs.\"BJP stood firmly behind the Yogi. Party spokesman Siddharth Nath Singh said, \"That image (of a saffron icon) may be with media but he has been elected again and again. He stands for development and that is the agenda we have got.\"Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the lone Muslim minister in the Modi government, defended the choice, saying Adityanath would work for the party's agenda of \"inclusive growth\".Samajwadi Party MP Naresh Agrawal reacted cautiously to Adityanath's elevation. \"We will wait and watch for six months.\"\"We hope he will change his thinking and desist from creating a divide between Hindus and Muslims. If he does, we will go among the people and oppose him,\" he said.CPM's Brinda Karat termed Adityanath's election a part of \"RSS agenda\". She said, \"It is clearly the RSS agenda and UP is the new experimental field for it. Since it is the victory of RSS (in UP elections), it has chosen the CM.This gentleman has a criminal record.Several charges like rioting and more serious offences exist against him in various courts in UP ... Then why this rhetoric of ending criminalisation?\" National Conference member Omar Abdullah, tweeted, \"Can spokespersons of BJP now put to rest their oft repeated assertion that RSS is only a social organisation?\" JD(U) spokesperson Harivansh said Yogi was \"the natural choice and fit into the politics that BJP follows\".\n",

      "\n",
      "Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma will be the deputy CMs of the state. The BJP had swept the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections by winning 312 of the 403 assembly seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adityanath’s name was proposed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suresh Khanna and was supported by Union Information and Broadcasting Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Known for his firebrand Hindutva image, the 44-year-old Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader comes from the Rajput community and is the head of the Gorakhnath Mutt in Gorakhpur, which has millions of followers from eastern UP and neighbouring Nepal.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has been elected as the Lok Sabha MP from Gorakhpur uninterrupted from 1998. A science graduate, Adityanath is popular for his fiery speeches among his supporters but has antagonised minorities by his speeches and statements like Love Jihad, Ghar Wapasi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, addressing the media, Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said even after the proposal was made, he asked the 312 newly elected MLAs if they wanted to propose anybody else for the post, but they all backed Adityanath unanimously.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that the Yogi then said he needed two deputy CMs to assist him in the gigantic task, following which it was decided that Maurya and Sharma would hold the posts.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the meeting was about to begin, an element of surprise gripped the venue when Adityanath reached Lok Bhawan opposite the imposing Assembly complex. Midway through the meeting, Sharma was asked to attend the deliberations. Interestingly, none of the three is a legislator in Uttar Pradesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as it was decided that the saffron-robed Gorakhpur MP will hold the reins of the state, party leaders and MLAs rushed to the dais with sweets and garlands. Adityanath will be the 21st chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and the fourth from the saffron party. He will be sworn in today at a ceremony at Kanshiram Smriti Upvan at 2.15 PM where Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah will be present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adityanath's elevation as the Chief Minister of the volatile state would mark the culmination of an aggressive two-pronged election campaign by the BJP in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about the party’s development agenda, but sundry leaders raked up the issue of Ram temple.\n",
      "\n",
      "The campaign acquired communal overtones following Modi’s “Kabristan and Shamshan” remark at an election rally. A strong votary of construction of the Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, Adityanath drove BJP’s Hindutva campaign in the eastern UP in the just concluded Assembly polls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yogi, who wears ‘Hindutva’ on his sleeve and has been accused of involvement in quite a few communal incidents in the past, wields considerable influence among the Hindu hardliners. He is not known to enjoy good rapport with the BJP leadership and his elevation has left many puzzled, with political circles abuzz with talk of RSS having prevailed over the party in deciding the new chief minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adityanath has rebelled against his party on several occasions, but because of the sway he holds over the ‘Hindu’ voters, the BJP apparently could not ignore his ‘leadership qualities’. Naidu said, “This is a historic win. This is a watershed moment for BJP…BJP has become a common man’s party. UP message is very clear and it is that country wants to move with Modi.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mandate is for development, mandate is against corruption, against black money…,” he said, with the Yogi by his side. “This mandate is against caste politics, religous politics and vote bank politics,” he said, noting that all the five regions in UP and all communities had overwhlemingly voted for the saffron party.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the just-concluded Assembly elections, the BJP, riding a Modi wave, stormed to power in Uttar Pradesh, securing a three-fourth majority and demolishing rivals SP-Congress and BSP.\n",

      "you are here: Home News Politics Mar 18, 2017 06:04 PM IST | Source: PTI New UP chief minister to be decided today: Here are the likely contenders Central observers - Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu and national general secretary Bhupendra Yadav - will remain present at the meeting to elect the chief minister. BJP vice-president Om Mathur, state party chief Keshav Prasad Maurya and other senior party leaders are also likely to attend the meet. Moneycontrol News Firebrand BJP MP Yogi Adityanath is the new frontrunner in the race to become Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister as newly-elected party legislators gathered in Lucknow on Saturday to elect a leader. Two deputy chief ministers may also be announced, according to News18. The meeting of the BJP's legislature party began at Lok Bhawan on Saturday evening, state BJP spokesperson Manish Dixit said. Central observers - Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu and national general secretary Bhupendra Yadav - will remain present at the meeting to elect the chief minister. BJP vice-president Om Mathur, state party chief Keshav Prasad Maurya and other senior party leaders are also likely to attend the meet. \"The new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh along with his Cabinet colleagues would take oath on March 19 at 5.00 PM at Kanshiram Smriti Upvan,\" Governor Ram Naik had said in a statement yesterday. Apart from Adityanath, Union Minister Manoj Sinha, Home Minister and former state chief minister Rajnath Singh, Maurya and eight-time MLA from Shahjahanpur Suresh Khanna are being projected as the main contenders for the post by their partymen. All these leaders in their interactions with the media have played down their chances. Sinha was in Varanasi yesterday where he offered prayers at Sankatmochan temple. The BJP is forming government in the politically crucial state after a gap of 15 years. In the recently-concluded Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the party secured 312 seats in a 403-member house, while its allies Apna Dal (Soneylal) and Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party got nine and four seats respectively. Samajwadi Party bagged 47 seats, while its ally the Congress stooped to its lowest tally with seven seats. Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party could manage to get only 19 seats in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly. With the BJP leadership often springing a surprise with its choice of state leaders like Manohar Lal Khattar in Haryana, Vijay Rupani in Gujarat and now Trivendra Singh Rawat in Uttarakhand, sources have said that a relatively lesser known leader cannot be ruled out. The central observers will most likely inform the MLAs about the BJP top brass' choice which will be subsequently endorsed at the meeting today. The BJP top brass has taken its time to decide on the UP Chief Minister after results were declared on March 11. The sources said the party is extra cautious as it is returning to power in Uttar Pradesh after a 15-year hiatus. Moreover, in view of Lok Sabha election in 2019, BJP cannot afford to take any wrong decision, said some party insiders when asked about the delay in declaring the CM's name. After a stupendous win in the Assembly election, the party can ill afford to lower its guard. Uttar Pradesh sends 80 MPs to Lok Sabha and is extremely important in the BJP's scheme of things. Party insiders said the overwhelming mandate has posed a fresh challenge for the BJP to meet sky-high expectations. \n",

      "+ बाद में पढ़ें योगी आदित्यनाथ उर्फ अजय सिंह बिष्ट उत्तर प्रदेश के चौथे ऐसे मुख्यमंत्री होंगे जो मूलरूप से उत्तराखंड से हैं। आदित्यनाथ गढ़वाल के पौड़ी जिले के पंचुर गांव के मूल निवासी हैं। हालांकि लंबे समय से वह गोरखनाथ पीठ से जुड़े होने के कारण गोरखपुर में रह रहे हैं। यूपी की राजनीति में उत्तराखंड के राजनेताओं का प्रभाव शुरुआती समय से देखने को मिला है। गोविंद बल्लभ पंत, हेमवती नंदन बहुगुणा ने बतौर मुख्यमंत्री अपनी अच्छे प्रशासक की छाप छोड़ी है। वहीं उत्तराखंड के नारायण दत्त तिवारी ने मुख्यमंत्री के तौर पर तीन बार यूपी का प्रतिनिधित्व किया है। हालांकि ये तीनों मुख्यमंत्री उस समय रहे जब उत्तराखंड यूपी से अलग नहीं हुआ था। आदित्यनाथ का बचपन उत्तराखंड में बीता है और शिक्षा भी वहीं हुई हैं। आदित्यनाथ ने एक समय छात्रसंघ का चुनाव भी लड़ा था। हालांकि महासचिव पद पर उनकी जीत नहीं हुई थी। दरअसल आदित्यनाथ गोरखनाथ धाम के महंत अवैद्यनाथ के भांजे हैं। मामा ने आदित्यनाथ को धर्म की राह से जोड़ा है। महंत अवैद्यनाथ भी कांडीगांव से ताल्लुक रखते थे। बताते हैं कि अवैद्यनाथ ने आदित्यनाथ को उनके माता-पिता से गोद ले लिया और अपने साथ गोरखपुर ले गए। महंत अवैद्यनाथ के निधन के बाद आदित्यनाथ को महंत की गद्दी मिली। महंत अवैद्यनाथ की तरह ही आदित्यनाथ भी धर्मगुरु की छवि के साथ राजनीति से भी जुड़ गए। कैसा लगा Write a Comment | View Comments Browse By Tags manoj sinha bjp rss narendra modi yogi adityanath up chief minister amit shah uttar pradesh chief minister up cm up cm candidate bjp up cm 2017 cm of up new cm of up up cm candidate More ... स्पॉटलाइट {\"_id\":\"58cd36da4f1c1b277532a7af\",\"slug\":\"aishwarya-rai-bachchan-s-father-krishnaraj-rai-passes-away\",\"type\":\"feature-story\",\"status\":\"publish\",\"title_hn\":\"\\u0910\\u0936\\u094d\\u0935\\u0930\\u094d\\u092f\\u093e \\u0915\\u0947 \\u092a\\u093f\\u0924\\u093e \\u0915\\u093e \\u092e\\u0941\\u0902\\u092c\\u0908 \\u092e\\u0947\\u0902 \\u0928\\u093f\\u0927\\u0928, \\u0932\\u0902\\u092c\\u0947 \\u0938\\u092e\\u092f \\u0938\\u0947 \\u0925\\u0947 \\u092c\\u0940\\u092e\\u093e\\u0930\",\"category\":{\"title\":\"Bollywood\",\"title_hn\":\"\\u092c\\u0949\\u0932\\u0940\\u0935\\u0941\\u0921\",\"slug\":\"bollywood\"}}\n",

      "+ बाद में पढ़ें सांसद योगी आदित्यनाथ को उ.प्र. भाजपा विधायक दल का चेहरा और राज्य का मुख्यमंत्री चुनकर भाजपा ने साबित कर दिया कि पार्टी ने पैराशूट से सीएम नहीं उतारा। योगी आदित्यनाथ जहां पांच बार के सांसद हैं, वहीं उ.प्र. में बड़ा जनाधार रखते हैं। उ.प्र. विधानसभा चुनाव वह न केवल पार्टी के स्टार प्रचारक थे, बल्कि पूर्वांचल के राजनीतिक समीकरण में उनकी बड़ी भूमिका थी। इसी के साथ पार्टी ने प्रदेश भाजपा अध्यक्ष और सांसद केशव प्रसाद मौर्य और लखनऊ के मेयर दिनेश शर्मा उ.प्र. का उपमुख्यमंत्री बनाने का निर्णय लिया है। वरिष्ठ केन्द्रीय मंत्री वेंकैया नायडू के अनुसार दोनों उपमुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ की दो सहयोगी की मांग पर दिए गए हैं, लेकिन करीब से जानने वालों को पता है कि राज्य को नेतृत्व देने में पार्टी के शीर्ष नेतृत्व तथा संघ ने खूब पसीना बहाया है। 11 मार्च को चुनाव नतीजे आने के बाद भाजपा ने गोवा और मणिपुर में बिना समय गंवाए सरकार बनाने की पहल शुरू कर दी। जबकि उ.प्र. और उत्तराखंड में सीएम का चेहरा तय करने में शीर्ष नेतृत्व को काफी मशक्कत करनी पड़ी। हालांकि पार्टी के एक केन्द्रीय मंत्री के अनुसार उ.प्र. के मुख्यमंत्री को लेकर राष्ट्रीय मीडिया ने खूब काइट फ्लाइंग की, लेकिन अचानक योगी आदित्यनाथ का दिल्ली आना, पार्टी के राष्ट्रीय अद्यक्ष अमित शाह से मिलना आदि पर वह चुप्पी साथ जाते हैं। सूत्र बताते हैं कि पार्टी के राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष द्वारा केशव प्रसाद मौर्य की भूमिका बताने और मौर्य की तबियत बिगडऩे के बाद से रायसीना हिल्स का तापमान कई बार चढ़ा-उतरा। झंडेवालान में केशवकुंज से लेकर नागपुर और दिल्ली की टेलीफोन घंटी काफी बजी। राजस्थान के राज्यपाल कल्याण सिंह से लेकर उ.प्र. के कुछ शीर्ष नेताओं ने भी अपनी राय को आगे बढ़ाया। भाजपा अध्यक्ष अमित शाह, ओम माथुर, सुनील बंसल और प्रधानमंत्री को इसके लिए काफी मंथन करना पड़ा। इस दौरान केन्द्रीय नेतृत्व के सामने कई चेहरे मुख्यमंत्री की रेस में आए। केन्द्रीय गृहमंत्री राजनाथ सिंह, केन्द्रीय दूर संचार राज्यमंत्री मनोज सिन्हा, योगी आदित्यनाथ आदि-आदि। अंतत: केन्द्रीय नेतृत्व ने संघ से मशविरा के बाद कट्टर हिन्दुत्व की छवि रखने वाले गोरखपुर के सांसद आदित्यनाथ को यह जिम्मेदारी सौंपने का मन बनाया। केशव प्रसाद को मिला ईनाम उ.प्र. विधानसभा चुनाव में केशव प्रसाद मौर्य ने अपनी सांगठनिक क्षमता साबित की थी। हालांकि केशव के खिलाफ अपराधिक मामले भी दर्ज हुए हैं, लेकिन पार्टी के शीर्ष नेतृत्व उनकी क्षमता, मेहनत आदि को देखते उन्हें इसका ईनाम दिया है। वहीं योगी आदित्यनाथ को मिले दूसरे सहयोगी दिनेश शर्मा गुजरात राज्य के प्रभारी हैं। राजनीति की अच्छी समझ रखते हैं। मिलनसार हैं और प्रधानमंत्री नरेन्द्र मोदी तथा भाजपा अध्यक्ष अमित शाह के काफी निकट हैं। माना जा रहा है कि उन्हें इसका ईनाम मिला है। 325 विधायक में कोई काबिल नहीं एक सवाल तैर रहा है। भाजपा को उ.प्र. में सहयोगी दलों के साथ 325 सीटे मिली हैं, लेकिन इनमें से विधायकों और पार्टी के शीर्ष नेतृत्व को कोई भी चेहरा मुख्यमंत्री के काबिल समझ में नहीं आया। हालांकि शीर्ष नेतृत्व से सुरेश खन्ना और सतीश महाना समेत तमाम विधायकों ने भेंट की थी। मुख्यमंत्री पद के लिए नाम भी उछला, लेकिन किसी कोभ शीर्ष या दो उप शीर्ष पदों की जिम्मेदारी नहीं मिल पाई। राजनाथ थे अनिच्छुक केन्द्रीय गृहमंत्री राजनाथ सिंह अपनी वरिष्ठता को ध्यान में रखकर अनिच्छुक थे। उ.प्र. के इस कद्दावर राजनीतिज्ञ ने 60 के दशक से राजनीतिक यात्रा की शुरुआत की थी। 1990 के दशक में उ.प्र. के शिक्षा मंत्री और बाद में मुख्यमंत्री भी बने थे। अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी की सरकार में कृषि मंत्री रहे राजनाथ भाजपा अध्यक्ष के तौर पर तीन बार की पारी खेल चुके हैं। प्रधानमंत्री मोदी की कैबिनेट में दूसरा स्थान रखते हैं। ऐसे में सूत्र बताते हैं कि संघ की पहली पसंद होने के बाद भी दो उप मुख्यमंत्रियों के साथ उन्हें प्रदेश का प्रभार संभालना गंवारा नहीं था। उन्होंने केन्द्र सरकार में गृहमंत्री बने रहना ही ठीक समझा। हिन्दुत्व, जाति सब साधा योगी आदित्यनाथ(पूर्व में अजय सिंह) पांच बार सांसद रह चुके हैं। उत्तराखंड के पौड़ी गढ़वाल में पैदा हुए गोरक्षपीठाधीश्वर गोरखपुर के सांसद और नाथ संप्रदाय के महंत हैं। गोरखपुर, देवरिया समेत आस-पास क्षत्रिय समाज में भी अच्छा खासा दबदबा रखते हैं। साथ में कठोर हिन्दुत्व की छवि भी है। इतना ही नहीं उ.प्र. और खासकर पूर्वांचल में भाजपा, संघ और हिन्दुत्व की राजनीति को आगे बढ़ाने वाले प्रखर नेता हैं। इस तरह से राजनाथ नहीं तो योगी आदित्यनाथ। केशव प्रसाद मौर्य पिछड़ी मौर्य जाति से हैं। गोरक्षा अभियान से जुड़े विश्व हिन्दु परिषद के कर्मठ सदस्य रहे हैं। स्व. अशोक सिंघल का वरदहस्त रहा है। अन्य पिछड़ी जातियों ने इस बार जमकर भाजपा के पक्ष में मतदान किया और केशव प्रसाद मौर्य के रूप में पार्टी ने संदेश देने की कोशिश की। दिनेश शर्मा ब्राह्मण चेहरा हैं। इस तरह से पार्टी के विधायक सुरेश खन्ना से प्रस्ताव रखवाकर भाजपा ने राज्य में सरकार के गठन का लक्ष्य हासिल कर लिया है। सावधानी से लिखी गई पटकथा शीर्ष नेतृत्व ने मुख्यमंत्री के नाम पर विधायकों की मुहर लगवाने की पटकथा बेहद सावधानी से लिखी। केन्द्रीय दूर संचार मंत्री का नाम मुख्यमंत्री के तौर पर मीडिया में आगे बढऩे और कई तरह की मांग उभरने के बीच सूत्र बताते हैं कि रणनीति पर अमल तेज हो गया। इसबीच मनोज सिन्हा कुछ शीर्ष नेताओं से मिलकर शुक्रवार की शाम को वाराणसी चले गए। उनके घर की सुरक्षा भी बढ़ा दी गई। सुबह वह काशी के कोतवाल और बाबा विश्वनाथ का दर्शन भी किया। तबतक उ.प्र. के मुख्यमंत्री के तौर पर मनोज सिन्हा ही मीडिया में चल रहे थे। इस बीच शनिवार को योगी आदित्यनाथ और केशव प्रसाद ने भाजपा अध्यक्ष से मुलाकात की और लखनऊ चले गए। तीन तीर से कई निशाने भाजपा शीर्ष नेतृत्व ने एक तीर से कई निशाने साधे हैं। योगी आदित्यनाथ के चयन से जहां पार्टी संघ के एजेंडे, हिन्दुत्व के संदेश को बनाए रखने में सफल हुई है, वहीं एक नेता विशेष के विकल्प को भी खड़ा कर दिया है। दो उप मुख्यमंत्रियों केशव प्रसाद और दिनेश शर्मा के चयन के जरिए पार्टी ने संदेश देने की कोशिश की है कि अनुशासित नेता का कभी नुकसान नहीं होता। शीर्ष नेतृत्व कभी उनकी मेहनत बेकार नहीं होने देता। अनुभव की कमी, लेकिन इरादे नेक प्रधानमंत्री नरेन्द्र मोदी का मंत्र है। अनुभव की भले कमी हो लेकिन इरादे नेक होने चाहिए। पार्टी के विधायकों ने इसी को ध्यान में रखकर योगी आदित्यनाथ को अपना नेता चुना है। योगी आदित्यनाथ और उनके दो सहयोगी उपमुख्यमंत्री के प्रशासनिक कामकाज का कोई खास अनुभव नहीं है। तीनों पदाधिकारी कभी मंत्री अथवा किसी संवैधानिक पद पर नहीं रहे हैं, लेकिन तीनों के कठिन परिश्रम, समझ, तालमेल बनाने की क्षमता तथा लक्ष्य को धयान में रखकर जूझने की मुहिम से इनकार नहीं किया जा सकता। कैसा लगा Write a Comment | View Comments Browse By Tags up election bjp up cm yogi adityanath gorakhpur keshav

      "An American man has been charged with hate crime for assaulting an Indian-origin man and hurling racial slurs, mistaking him for a Muslim. Jeffrey Allen Burgess, 54, of Pennsylvania, has been accused of intentionally harming a man named Ankur Mehta on November 22, because of his \"perceived race, colour and national origin\". If convicted Burgess faces a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years of prison, a fine of $250,000 or both. The indictment of Burgess comes amid a serious of suspected hate crime cases targeting Indian-Americans. \n",
      "America is number one economy and the most powerful nation of the world. One of the reasons of its strength is due to its strong rule of law. Whether it is an ordinary man or the President himself, if found guilty, it will spare none. Unfortunately, we have a law which gives a long rope to politicians and economic offenders to brazenly delay and dodge the deliverance of justice. The biggest and confirmed hate crime spreader and a towering example of racial slurs, Yogi Adityanath, has been made the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. This is the climax of hate reward. What is in store during the remainder of two years more of the BJP rule? Hate is the lowest quality of a human being. God save the country! \n",

      "Yogi Adityanath will be the new UP CM 0 Firebrand and aggressive Hindutva champion is set to lead the UP Government...BJP has finally recognised the importance of actively pursuing Hindutva..As I said earlier the Ayodhya Ram Temple has to be built now without any further delay!! Hindutva can go hand in hand with Development! Happy to see a person who is an ascetic ruling Indias largest State with 20 Crores population and size of Brazil!! 7 reasons why Adityanath as Uttar Pradesh chief minister is a BJP masterstroke Issues such as corruption, law and order and women's safety will be handled well by Yogi Adityanath. He is the right candidate and one who can handle every kind of challenge in UP, said Uma Bharti. IndiaToday.in | Posted by Ankit Misra New Delhi, March 18, 2017 Ending days of uncertainty, the Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday announced that Yogi Adityanath would be the next Uttar Pradesh chief minister. The swearing-in ceremony is scheduled to take place in Lucknow around 5 pm on Sunday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah among other senior party leaders are expected to be present on the occasion. The five-time Gorakhpur MP was picked ahead of the other two front-runners for the top post - UP BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya and Union Minister Manoj Sinha . Adityanath will have two deputy chief ministers in Maurya and BJP legislator Dinesh Sharma. Union Minister Uma Bharti has welcomed Adityanath's elevation. She said, \"I am very happy with this decision. Issues such as corruption, law and order and women's safety will be handled well by Yogi Adityanath. He is the right candidate and one who can handle every kind of challenge in UP.\" Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh said, \"I congratulate Yogi Adityanath, hope under him Uttar Pradesh will reach new heights of development.\" 7 REASONS WHY CHOOSING ADITYANATH MAY HELP BJP GAIN A STRONGER FOOTHOLD POLITICAL NARRATIVE: A part of the pre-election narrative that has helped the BJP in the elections will continue as the opposition will link Yogi's appointment with BJP not giving any ticket to Muslims. RELIGION vs CASTE: Religion helped BJP create a larger vote bank than the caste vote banks already present in the state. To keep the edge that BJP has gained in these elections, Yogi may keep religion at the forefront. YOGI vs SURNAME: As Ajay Singh, he's immediately recognised as a Thakur, as Yogi the caste goes in the background. DEPUTIES TO BALANCE: The two deputy chief ministers will enable the BJP to talk differently with different stakeholders - development when needed, religion when needed. RISK OF AMBITION: Adityanath's earlier rejection of different roles at the Centre showed his determination for the CM's chair. Disappointing Adityanath may have been risky for BJP. CADRE vs LEADERS: A vocal and dedicated cadre support could have forced the BJP's hand much like Modi's anointment as PM candidate in 2014. EXPERIMENTS ARE FOR LABS: The road to Delhi goes via Lucknow. What better way to experiment Hindutva in the run-up to the 2019 general elections than in India's largest state. If it works for Uttar Pradesh, the BJP will definitely be looking to make it work across India.\n",

MP, head of Gorakhnath temple and a political rabble-rouser assembly elections Updated: Mar 18, 2017 20:28 IST Abdul Jadid Hindustan Times, Lucknow Yogi Adityanath arrive at Parliament House to attend the Budget session, on Wednesday, March 15, 2017. The Gorakhpur MP was named new Uttar Pradesh CM on March 18.(Sonu Mehta/HT PHOTO) \n",
      "Yogi Adityanath, a firebrand BJP leader and a five-time MP from Gorakhpur, was named on Saturday as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, exacly a week after the party took control of the state with a brute majority. \n",
      "HT traces his life and career as one of the most polarising political figures in India. \n",
      "The beginning of political innings: It was in the year 1998 when Yogi Adityanath entered the political arena after leaving his ancestral home at Pancher village in Pauri Garhwal where he was born on June 5, 1972. He was born Ajay Mohan Bisht but later changed his name after his indoctrination into the Nath sect. \n",
      "The year saw former BJP MP Mahant Avidyanath, a key leader of 90’s Ram Temple movement, passing his baton to Yogi Adityanath who emerged as a controversial Hindu leader known for hate speeches. \n",
      "A B.Sc graduate (1993) from Garhwal University in Uttrakhand, Yogi made his Parliament debut after winning the election in 1998 from Gorakhpur. He continued to win the seat for five times with large margins, except in 2004 when the Samajwadi Party’s Jamuna Nishad gave him tough fight. He won by just 5,000 votes. \n",
      "Chief priest of Gorakhnath temple: Adityanath received deeksha (teachings) of the Nath sect at the Gorakhnath temple in February, 1994. As per the sect’s traditions, his ears were pierced amid rituals associated with the temple. He addressed Mahant Avidyanath, his maternal uncle, as Guruji. Yogi Adityanath took over as chief priest of Gorakhnath temple after Mahant Avidyanath passed away in 2014. \n",
      "Major controversies/criminal cases : Adityanath’s radical pro-Hindutva image came to the fore for the first in February 1999, when he allegedly tried to capture a graveyard land by planting a peepal tree at Panch Rukhiya village in Maharajganj district. A case under several sections was registered against him in the Kotwali police station. \n",
      "In 2007, just before the assembly elections, Adityanath had to spend 15 days in jail when he was booked for inciting riots in Gorakhpur and adjoining areas which saw the killing of a Muslim youth. Riots broke out after a provocative speech by Adityanath following the killing of a Hindu youth in January. He was booked again by police. He is still facing trial in the two cases. Read more Ghaziabad: Yogi Adityanath accuses political parties of snowballing issues of minorities \n",
      "Strained relations with BJP: In 2007, upset with the BJP for not helping him during a crisis when he was jailed for communal riots, Adityanath fielded candidates from his nationalist outfit, the Hindu Yuva Vahini, against party nominees. The same year, he showed his clout when he fielded and ensured a victory for Radha Mohan Das Aggarwal on a Hindu Mahasabha ticket. Adityanath was ignored by the central leadership as he was not inducted in the Modi ministry despite being a law-maker for five times. \n",
      "Saints demand Yogi as CM candidate : Even as the BJP constantly ignored growing demands to project Yogi Adityanath as the party’s CM candidate, a meeting of saints and seers from Ayodhya and other places, held at the Gorakhnath temple in 2016, pitched Yogi as the CM face and pointed out that decks for construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya could only be cleared when Yogi becomes the chief minister. Read more Adityanath’s group offers guns to ‘harassed’ Hindus of Bisada \n",
      "Polarising figure in 2017 polls: Adityanath helped BJP reap the benefits of a highly polarised Uttar Pradesh. He had first raked up the issue of alleged discrimination in power supply during Hindu and Muslim festivals and also in allocation of land for kabristan and shamshan, which was later highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had also made highly controversial comments on issues such as love jihad, cow slaughter and forcible conversion. \n",
      "Handled rebellion: A faction of Adityanath’s HYV revolted when its members were denied tickets by BJP in the just concluded assembly elections. They emerged as big trouble for BJP by announcing to contest election against saffron party candidates in alliance with Shiv Sena. The revolt was immediately crushed by Yogi who sacked rebel leaders. Later, some rebels took back their nominations on his initiative. tags \n",

      "Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath was chosen to be the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh on Saturday. Finally the race of UP elections has came to an end with the proof of enormous trust that people of UP have on Narendra Modi. This result was a proof that apart from ‘hindu-muslim issue’ or ‘dalit’ issue, people are showing interest in overall development and unbiased upliftment of all community. The suspense on who will lead India’s largest state got over today after the BJP picked Yogi Adityanath as the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. Good choice for India.\n",

      "With Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who is the fringe now? 19.03.2017 tweet \n",
      "“I find western UP unsafe. We do not face a threat in eastern UP because there we use the language that people understand and set them straight…,” Yogi Adityanath said at one of the many election rallies in Uttar Pradesh. \n",
      "Call it political shrewdness or politics of polarisation, the BJP finally decided to name Member of Parliament from Gorakhpur Yogi Adityanath as the next chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. With a brute majority of 312 MLAs, the BJP is well within its right to pick any leader it wants to lead one of the largest states in the country. Yogi’s coronation as the next UP chief minister, however, is problematic in many ways. \n",
      "For long he was identified as the fringe who “doesn’t really come in the way of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ‘s vision of inclusiveness”. The party had cultivated and successfully set a narrative of the fringe and the mainstream voices within the party. But all along, the BJP seemed to gain from what the fringe was unleashing – the cow vigilantes, Kairana exodus, Ramzada and haramzada brigade etc. Even as political analysts were trying to read and decode the party’s massive victory in the elections, it was looking clear that BJP will form its government on the agenda of governance. May be there was a sense of denial that the BJP would even consider Yogi Adityanath as the contender for the chief minister’s post. But then, victory is what matters in electoral politics. So what if that victory comes at the cost of social disharmony? \n",
      "The facade has now crumbled. There is no more pretense and the message is loud and clear: those who promote communalism will be rewarded in the party. A Hindutva posterboy, Yogi Adityanath has always hogged the headlines for his hate speeches. In 2014, the Election Commission had ordered an FIR against him for speeches targeting the Muslim community. After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when the BJP came to power with a landslide majority, he led the hate agenda, making provocative comments, one after the other. \n",
      "In the run up to the UP Assembly elections, he had compared the situation in western Uttar Pradesh to that of Kashmir. “When I look at western UP, I have regrets… when I see the social framework and demography… On January 19, 1990, Hindus had to migrate collectively from Kashmir. A massacre took place, the honour of mothers and sisters were openly tramped upon. If we have seen a sight similar to this anywhere, it was either in Bengal or western UP. Kairana and Kandhla are examples,” he had said. \n",
      "Soon after the announcement of Yogi as chief minister, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated his slogan of collective aspirations for development of India at the India Today Conclave. But if we go back to UP elections, BJP’s candidates’ list exposes the majoritarian agenda of the party – a counter claim to what PM Modi wants us to believe in. Muslims constitute close to 20 per cent of the state’s population. But the BJP didn’t find even one suitable candidate from the community to field in any of the 403 seats in the state Assembly. Well, the argument could be political expediency and winnability factor for not giving tickets to any candidate from the minority community. But the subtext of the argument is that the BJP doesn’t really care for the Muslim vote. The BJP, nevertheless, swept the polls. And soon came the claim of victory of the development agenda of the party under PM Modi and Amit Shah. But that wasn’t to be. \n",
      "The development wave that was successfully sold seems to be already getting a reality check. Was there any inclusive agenda in UP at all? PM Modi had also stirred the communal pot when he invoked kabristan and shamsan during his election rallies in the state. Interestingly, these remarks were not seen as appeasement of a subtle kind. \n",
      "There was always this exclusive agenda at play, just that it was coated in the charade of development plank. And Yogi Adityanath as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, is perhaps the personification of that agenda. \n",

      "How Yogi Adityanath overcame political ignominy to win the UP crown 19.03.2017 tweet \n",
      "A number of factors – including a vocal Hindutva agenda and the backing of everybody from RSS and VHP members to Hindu godmen – helped Yogi Adityanath win the Uttar Pradesh crown. \n",
      "Yogi had been in the reckoning for the chief minister’s post ever since the BJP won the state assembly elections by a landslide. However, as days passed, the focus shifted on others like Union home minister Rajnath Singh, minister of state for telecommunications (independent charge) Manoj Sinha, BJP national general secretary (organisation) Ram Lal, and state unit president Keshav Prasad Maurya. \n",
      "After Trivendra Rawat – a member of the Rajput community – was appointed as the Uttarakhand chief minister, it was believed that a non-Rajput would head the Uttar Pradesh government. As Adityanath is also a Rajput, Sinha and Maurya seemed like frontrunners for the post. \n",
      "On Friday evening, the BJP leadership dispatched a communiqué asking its 312 MLAs to attend the legislature party meeting at the Lok Bhawan auditorium. The yogi’s supporters remained on tenterhooks. \n",
      "The next morning, however, saw a twist in the tale. BJP national president Amit Shah called Adityanath – who was in Gorakhpur – over the phone, asking him to leave for Delhi immediately. \n",
      "By the time Adityanath boarded a charted plane bound for the national capital, the rumour mills had already begun running overtime. While many believed he had been called to discuss the appointment of ministers in the state cabinet, not even his most ardent supporters were aware of the events unfolding in Delhi. \n",
      "That afternoon, there was word that Adityanath had been told to go to Lucknow after his meeting with Shah. Jubilant workers hit the streets, distributing sweets to passersby. “It’s now clear that Chotey Maharaj (as the yogi is popularly known in Gorakhpur) will be our new chief minister,” said Upendra Mishra, a BJP worker. \n",
      "Adityanath, a five-time MP, had held the fort in Gorakhpur region even when the BJP faced defeats in the 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections. There remained no doubts about Adityanath’s influence in East Uttar Pradesh when the maximum number of BJP MLAs emerged victorious from Gorakhpur zone in the 2002, 2007 and 2012 polls. \n",
      "The yogi also won the confidence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi by organising massive rallies during campaigns for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections as well as the recently concluded assembly polls. His position as head of the Gorakhnath Temple Trust, which has a large following in East Uttar Pradesh as well as Bihar, further strengthened his claim for the top post. “What’s more, Chotey Maharaj’s spartan lifestyle matches that of the Prime Minister,” said a senior BJP leader. \n",
      "Adityanath established himself as a firebrand Hindutva leader after Mahanth Avaidyanath – BJP MP and erstwhile head priest of the Gorakhnath temple – appointed him as his successor. Contentious issues such as the construction of the Ram temple at Ayodhya, uniform civil code, ban on cow slaughter and the anti-conversion campaign topped his agenda. \n",
      "Adityanath entered into a dispute with the BJP leadership over ticket distribution in 2002, and threatened to launch a separate outfit. His aide, Radha Mohan Das Agarwal, contested the polls on a Hindu Mahasabha ticket and defeated BJP candidate Shiv Pratap Shukla. \n",
      "The yogi then launched the Hindu Yuva Vahini, which helped him establish his dominance over the region. He showed his strength by organising the Vishwa Hindu Mahasammelan in Gorakhpur, ensuring the participation of 970 Hindu organisations. The message to the BJP was loud and clear – they could not afford to ignore Adityanath. \n",
      "While the BJP MP has largely focused on Hindutva, one cannot overlook his contributions to the development cause either. Adityanath’s Facebook page highlights the various projects he launched in Gorakhpur – including the restarting of a fertiliser factory and launch of an AIIMS unit. Besides this, his temple runs dozens of educational institutions, hospitals, cow sheds and orphanages. \n",
      "The yogi also has a substantial following among the Dalit and backward communities. He has repeatedly spoken for the cause of marginalised communities such as the Musahars and Vantongiyas, ensuring their assimilation into mainstream society.\n",

      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s right-wing party has picked a controversial firebrand leader to head India’s most populous state, where it won a landslide victory last week. \n",
      "Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party won an absolute majority in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people and seen as a bellwether of national politics, in a massive vote of confidence for the premier halfway into his first term. \n",
      "After a meeting with local BJP legislators on Saturday, senior party leader M. Venkaiah Naidu announced 44-year-old Yogi Adityanath as Uttar Pradesh’s next chief minister. \n",
      "“Tomorrow Yogi Adityanath will take oath as chief minister,” Naidu said at a press conference in Uttar Pradesh’s capital, Lucknow, late on Saturday. \n",
      "Earlier, television footage showed BJP workers garlanding and feeding sweets to the Hindu hardliner who was draped in his iconic saffron-coloured robe. \n",
      "A five-time MP from the BJP, Adityanath is a popular leader known for his fiery Hindu rhetoric who has stirred controversies over his polarising and inflammatory speeches against Muslims – who form nearly 20 percent of the state’s population. \n",
      "Most recently, he lauded US President Trump’s travel ban that aimed to halt immigrants from a handful of Muslim-majority countries from entering the country, saying India needed similar action to check “terrorism”. \n",
      "Adityanath has often fanned flames over religious conversions, inter-religion marriages, and has reportedly been arrested and charged with several crimes in the past including rioting, attempt to murder and trespassing on burial places. \n",
      "He has also supported strong laws for cow protection, and said minority groups that oppose yoga should either leave the country or drown themselves in the sea. \n",
      "The rise of the Hindu priest-turned-politician in Uttar Pradesh, a state prone to sectarian strife, surprised many after Modi made his development agenda the focus of his campaign in the region, which is traditionally fractured along caste and religious lines. \n",
      "READ MORE – Narendra Modi: BJP sees bigger gains in 2019 election \n",
      "Observers questioned whether Adityanath would continue pushing his “Hindutva”, loosely translated as “Hinduness”, ideology as chief minister. \n",
      "“PM @narendramodi says development & growth is his primary agenda. Allowing Hindutva hardliners to helm a major state is a costly mistake,” said journalist Malini Parthasarathy on Twitter as #YogiAdityanath became a top-trending topic in India. \n",
      "But the BJP, which won 312 of the total 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh, reassured Adityanath would work for development and anti-corruption. \n",
      "“This mandate is against caste politics, religious politics,” Naidu said. \n",
      "With last week’s clear win in the politically crucial state, the BJP hopes to boost Modi’s chances for a second term in 2019 general elections, but it was unclear whether Adityanath’s appointment would help it get there or backfire. \n",

      "Mr. Adityanath heads the 15-year-old Hindu Yuva Vahini, which describes itself as a socio-cultural organisation, but has been involved in several incidents of violence in the past. \n",

      "His exclusion from the State BJP election committee before the Assembly polls led to protests by the Yuva Vahini, and it was only when he was deployed across the State, tempers were calmed. \n",
      "Yogi Adityanath has been the hard Hindutva face of the party in the 15 years it spent in political wilderness in the State and after the influence of former CM Kalyan Singh declined. He is no stranger to controversies. While his speech to the BJP MLAs after being elected their leader on Saturday was about development, his Hindutva image and “toughness” are the qualities for which he has been chosen, senior party leaders say. \n",
      "Adityanath is no stranger to controversy. Apart from the violence after his arrest in 2007, he compared film star Shah Rukh Khan to terrorist Hafiz Saeed during the debate on intolerance that had broken out in 2015, as well as demanding, again in 2015, that those who opposed the Surya Namaskar in Yoga could leave for Pakistan. \n",
      "Born Ajay Singh Bisht in Uttarakhand in 1972, Yogi Adityanath was adopted by Mahant Avaidyanath of the powerful Gorakhnath peeth in Gorakhpur as a teenager, gaining deeksha for sanyas or renunciation, at the peeth in 1994. When his Avaidyanath passed away, Adityanath inherited not just the peeth, but also the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat that was held by Avaidyanath for three terms, winning it for himself for five consecutive terms beginning in 1998. \n",

The local police too couldn’t help matters. But a dozen bikers with the Hindu Yuva Vahini flags turned up and escorted Mr. Shah’s car past the blockade,” recalled a close aide of Mr. Shah.

In Bihar, the BJP can at least sit back and hope for the alliance of desperate opposites to collapse under its own weight. Not so in Uttar Pradesh, where Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav will now march in lock step. There is another mahagathbandhan of Shiv Sena + Cong + NCP budding in Maharashtra.\n",
      "So, you have there the equation for 2019. Three big Mahagathbandhans in India’s 3 of India’s 4 largest states : Uttar Pradesh (80 seats), Maharashtra (48 seats) and Bihar (40 seats). The other state in the big four is West Bengal (42 seats), where the BJP is still a bit player.\n",
      "What was Modi supposed to do here? Become another Vajpayee and fade into the sunset, leaving the Dynasty and its NGO jackals to snap up the economic gains founded on his five years of hard work?\n",
      "By picking Yogi Adityanath as CM, Modi has shown that he will play his best hand for 2019. He wont go down without a fight, like liberals wanted him to. The state of Uttar Pradesh will be run directly from the Prime Minister’s Office. Lucknow is too important for him not to deliver on his promises of development. But, honestly, what “vikas” could he possibly have given in (less than 2 years) that would have taken the BJP’s vote share from 40% to 51% so that he can fight the Mahagathbandhan? Let’s be real.\n",
      "Modi needed a big face, a regional satrap who transcends caste. If you want to be really politically incorrect, you could say he needed someone who can unite the 80% against the 20%. Did he have another option that would give him a realistic chance in the fight against the Mahagathbandhan?\n",
      "So Modi went for broke. He went with the raw emotion of the grassroot BJP worker. Anyone who witnessed the wild celebrations of BJP workers in Lucknow yesterday would know that he had made the right decision. He will need every bit of that enthusiasm to fight the Mahagathbandhan.\n",
      "With Yogi’s coronation, depressed liberals who had been hiding in the woodwork for a week, will now come out all guns blazing. Who knows, even the Samajwadi Times might start tweeting again. But why should Modi listen to the people who would never ever vote for him? Why not go with the man who was most popular among BJP workers and worked the hardest in the election? Should he be sidelined simply because some smug people suddenly claim to know the mind of the BJP supporters they didn’t know existed until a week ago?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, Modi went with the BJP worker. I trust Modi and Shah to know their mind rather than Barkha Dutt. Those who didn’t have a single clue about the mandate until March 11 should not be in charge of interpreting the mandate.\n",
      "Yes, Modi has gone with the BJP worker and rewarded the hardest campaigner and the biggest mass leader they have in Uttar Pradesh. Keshav Maurya, who was an inspired choice by Amit Shah as the party’s OBC face, has also been amply accommodated. The Modi-Shah team picked their top players, ran with their strategy and won big.\n",
      "I would advise the right wing (not that they really need my advise) not to be perturbed by the outrage of liberals. Ha! Does anyone really think that liberals hate Narendra Modi any more today than they hated him yesterday?\n",
      "Of course not. The liberals want the BJP dead and gone. Done and dusted. Finished. Destroyed. Buried so deep under the ground that they wont find a trace of BJP in a thousand years. The appointment of one Hindutva firebrand as CM does not change their view of BJP. If yesterday they wanted the BJP buried 6000 feet under the ground, maybe liberals today want the BJP buried 6001 feet under the ground. Does it matter?\n",
      "Because liberals can live with everything, except BJP. They are happy to cuddle with Stalinists, but they can’t live with RSS. Do liberals really care about inclusive politics? Ha! This , for example, is Shiv Sena for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this did not deter the liberal media from discovering that Uddhav Thackeray is a mild mannered photographer with a heart of gold. Right around the time of the BMC polls. So, if you are a liberal and you are circulating speeches of Yogi Adityanath and pretending to be shocked, I am laughing at you.\n",
      "Modi has begun the fight for 2019. And in order to fight this historic election, he has chosen to believe in his own. And by making Yogi the Chief Minister, he has made it clear that he won’t let the enemy whisper in his ear while the battle is in progress.\n",

      "Lucknow: Priest-turned politician Yogi Adityanath, the controversial mascot of hardline Hindutva, was on Saturday named as next Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, in a move by the BJP that took many by surprise.\n",
      "Ending the suspense exactly a week after BJP won a three- fourths majority in the key Hindi heartland state and stormed back to power after 15 years, the 44-year-old five-term MP from Gorakhpur was unanimously elected the BJP legislature party leader at a meeting of the newly elected MLAs.\n",
      "Adityanath will be sworn in on Sunday at a ceremony where Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah will be present.\n",
      "State BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya, who was himself in contention for the top job besides union minister Manoj Sinha, first announced Adityanath’s election amid speculation that the RSS pushed for Yogi’s candidature. Maurya, the MP from Phulpur in Allahabad, will be the deputy chief minister apart from senior BJP leader and Lucknow Mayor Dinesh Sharma. Adityanath, who lacks administrative experience, will be the 21st chief minister of UP.\n",
      "‘Will ensure all-round development’\n",
      "After his election, Adityanath met Governor Ram Naik and said he was invited to form the government in UP. He said he would follow Prime Minister Modi’s slogan “sab ka saath, sab ka vikas” and ensure all round development of the country’s most populous state.\n",
      "“I am confident that the state will march on the path of development,” he said in his first brief media interaction at the Raj Bhawan.\n",
      "The Yogi said his efforts would be to provide “good governance” in the state.\n",
      "Criminal cases\n",
      "Adityanath has several criminal cases against him. He has been charged in the past with rioting, attempt to murder, armed with deadly weapon, endangering life or personal safety of others, unlawful assembly, trespassing on burial places and criminal intimidation.\n",
      "A murder case is going on in the court of CJM, Maharajganj, according to his 2014 election affidavit.\n",
      "He is not known to enjoy good rapport with the BJP leadership and his elevation has left many puzzled, with political circles abuzz with talk of RSS having prevailed over the party in deciding the new chief minister.\n",
      "Often caught in controversy because of his speeches, Adityanath allegedly led a “purification” drive for conversion of Christians to Hinduism in 2005.\n",
      "He was arrested for allegedly inciting Gorakhpur riots in 2007.\n",
      "A strong votary of construction of the Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, Adityanath drove BJP’s Hindutva campaign in the eastern UP in the just concluded Assembly polls.\n",
      "Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, who along with BJP general secretary Bhupendra Yadav was present at the meeting as central observer for the election, told a press conference that Adityanath’s name was proposed by Suresh Khanna, an 8- term MLA, and seconded by 10 others. Naidu said even after the proposal was made, he asked the 312 newly elected MLAs if they wanted to propose anybody else for the post, but they all backed Adityanath unanimously. Naidu said that the Yogi then said he needed two deputy CMs to assist him in the gigantic task, following which it was decided that Maurya and Sharma would hold the posts.\n",
      "As the meeting was about to begin, an element of surprise gripped the venue when Adityanath reached Lok Bhawan opposite the imposing Assembly complex.\n",
      "Midway through the meeting, Sharma was asked to attend the deliberations.\n",
      "Interestingly, none of the three is a legislator in UP.\n",
      "As soon as it was decided that the saffron-robed Gorakhpur MP will hold the reins of the state that raised eyebrows, party leaders and MLAs rushed to the dais with sweets and garlands.PTI\n",

There were many in the race, some of them the favourites of the two most powerful men in the country. But on Saturday, as the election of the new UP CM tossed from one name to another, the final selection proved one of the most surprising — Yogi Adityanath, who may not have been the first choice of the Modi-Shah duo.

      "Email The militant Yogi has built his political career out of spewing venom against Muslims Yogi Adityanath arrives to attend the BJP’s legislature party meeting in Lucknow on Saturday. Credit: PTI/Nand Kumar \n",
      "Sometime in the year 2015, a video surfaced on social media where the Hindutva hardliner and BJP leader Adityanath – who is also the caretaker of the famous Gorakhnath Mutt in Gorakhpur – sat silently on stage as a supporter gave a call to dig up the graves of Muslim women and rape them. While this dastardly call was widely criticised, the speaker, a member of the Hindu Yuva Vahini – a militant Hindutva organisation founded by Adityanath – declared that when the Yogi came to power, Muslims would be stripped of the right to vote and treated as “second-class citizens”. \n",
      "Two years later, Adityanath has indeed come to power – in Uttar Pradesh, if not India – and the state and country are waiting with bated breath to see exactly what this will mean. \n",
      "On Saturday, the BJP’s newly elected legislators met in Lucknow and unanimously chose the Yogi as the next chief minister of the India’s most populous state. \n",
      "With him at the helm, the party also nominated BJP’s state unit president Keshav Prasad Maurya and Lucknow’s mayor and national vice-president of the party Dinesh Sharma as deputy chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh. According to party sources, Adityanath’s assistants will take over as leaders-in-charge of eastern and western UP respectively. \n",
      "The nomination of a polarising figure like Adityanath , known for his frequent hate speeches against Muslims, marks a clear departure from the BJP’s stated agenda of ‘ sabka saath, sabka vikaas’ – the slogan it has used to declare it stands for all citizens. Ever since Narendra Modi rose to power at the centre, an undefined vision of “development” had remained at the forefront of the saffron party’s campaign. The party fought the UP’s election with this vision although its campaign was anchored by subtle and not-so-subtle communal overtones, especially against Muslims. \n",
      "With a massive mandate on its side and the renewed political confidence that goes with it, the BJP’s message to the people of UP is loud and clear – the creation of a ‘Hindu Rashtra’ was and is the party’s eventual political goal. And that the idea of development it intends to advance will remain focused on the Hindu majority. \n",
      "Leg up for upper castes \n",
      "Political analysts in Lucknow are of the opinion that the BJP, in attempting to create a three-faced leadership structure, has tried to balance the anxieties of various supportive caste groups even as it has subsumed caste identities within the broad Hindutva identity by nominating Adityanath, the 44-year-old, six-time MP from Gorakhpur who will now have to resign his parliamentary seat and get elected to the state legislature. \n",
      "The argument they make is that Adityanath represented Thakurs, who, with more than 60 elected MLAs, have the greatest ever political representation in the state. At the same time, Sharma and Keshav Prasad will become the face of Brahmins (around 12% of UP’s population) and Mauryas (the biggest non-Yadav OBC block in the state) – without whose support the BJP could not have managed such an overwhelming victory. \n",
      "These identity-driven representations are crucial in a state like UP. What, however, is a definitive break from the state’s recent political past is the nomination of two “forward” caste members as leaders of the state government. It was often assumed that states like UP and Bihar, which became the torchbearer of caste-based assertive movements in north India, were unlikely to have a “forward” caste CM . \n",
      "The BJP has, thus, made a strong statement by turning this perception upside down by handing the state back to someone whom the traditional feudal class see as one of their own. \n",
      "Adityanath will also be the first prominent leader of the party to become chief minister of a state after Modi took over at the centre. In states like Jharkhand and Haryana, which went to the polls after 2014 election, the party had chosen non-controversial and relatively lesser-known political figures to represent the state. Raghubar Das (CM of Jharkhand) and Manohar Lal Khattar (CM of Haryana) and even Vijay Rupani who replaced Anandiben Patel as the CM of Gujarat were perceived as good administrators rather than impressive leaders with a base of their own. \n",
      "Adityanath, with practically no administrative experience, is seen as the fiercest campaigner for Hindutva in the BJP’s national line-up. Although he was one of the party’s star campaigners in the run-up to polls, he attended only a few rallies, each of his appearances not lasting more than 10 minutes. This had led to the suspicion that he was being sidelined. However, the tables have turned clearly, leading to speculation that BJP’s parent organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, was instrumental in getting him the state’s top job. \n",
      "Muslim-baiting \n",
      "In all his speeches during the election campaign, Adityanath made only two points. One, that both the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party cared only for Muslims. And two, that Hindus should unitedly press the ‘lotus’ button in the polling booth in order to stop this “Muslim appeasement” . While he went on a verbal rampage against Muslims, his supporters kept pushing his name for CM. “ UP mein agar rahna hoga, toh Yogi Yogi kahna hoga (If you want to stay in UP, you will have to say Yogi Yogi)” went the most commonly raised slogan in Adityanath’s rallies. After the BJP’s victory, when all its leaders were claiming that the vote was a mandate towards the development of UP, Adityanath was the only one to stick his neck out and say that the BJP’s win symbolises the rejection of the politics of “Muslim appeasement.” \n",
      "What impact the appointment of the Hindutva footsoldier would have on UP’s politics and social fabric remains to be seen. But what is apparent at present is that for the first time after the BJP came to power in 2014 under the leadership of Modi, the party has elevated a leader who represents Hindutva militancy. Adityanath’s nomination as chief minister definitively indicates that the BJP does not see its twin agenda of development and Hindutva as mutually exclusive. \n",
      "The latest turn of events in UP also suggests that political debates in the state are likely to take place within the binaries set by Hindu nationalists – the centre-right represented by Modi and the far right, represented by Adityanath. What this would inevitably mean is that concerns of inclusive development – which parties like the SP and BSP raised even if their high-handedness and corruption robbed the ‘social justice’ agenda of actual substance – will be further pushed into background. \n",
      "For both the BJP and Adityanath, the elevation of the militant Yogi is mutually beneficial. The BJP, because of its tactical posturing as a development-oriented party in the last few years, has lost ground to far right parties like Shiv Sena and other fringe Hindutva groups. In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena and BJP, despite being allies, constantly debate between themselves. \n",
      "As for Adityanath. most of his close aides like Sunil Singh have left his vigilante Hindu Yuva Vahini after his victory in the 2014 elections and floated their own fronts. The divisions were so deep that Sunil Singh and many of his supporters contested the recent election on Shiv Sena tickets. Adityanath’s elevation as CM will help him consolidate his position as the sole Hindutva crusader in UP and keep his personal flock in Poorvanchal firmly together. \n",
      "From equating Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan with Pakistani terrorist Hafeez Sayyed and asking Muslims and Christians to come into the fold of Hinduism (ghar wapasi) to calling Mother Teresa a Christian conspirator and raising the bogey of “Love Jihad” against Muslims, Adityanath has done it all. He has also carried his rhetoric into parliament. During a discussion on communal violence in the Lok Sabha, in August 2014 Adityanath, who has always appealed to the Hindus to carry arms, had declared that “Hindus, when threatened, must be prepared to organise themselves and fight back.” \n",
      "The BJP’s decision to nominate such a divisive political figure raises troubling questions. Are we witnessing something new in Indian politics? Or is it a mere continuation of what started in 2014 with the nomination of Modi, an equally polarising figure, as PM. These questions will be discussed and debated in the days to come. On Saturday, however, the only political message that reflected from BJP’s stable was that the core of its agenda remains Hindutva – with other issues like development only a poor cover for it.

Yogi Adityanath, a five-time parliamentarian will be sworn in as the new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh today. The swearing-in happens in Lucknow a week after the BJP won a landslide mandate in the assembly elections with 312 seats. In a surprise announcement, Mr Adityanath's name was announced only last evening. He will have two deputies in Keshav Prasad Maurya, the party's UP chief, and Dinesh Sharma, Lucknow's Mayor. Mr Sharma is credited with leading the party's membership drive in the state.After his name was announced for the top post, Mr Adityanath thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who himself was an important part of the party's campaign in the state. \"I will take UP forward with his motto of sabka saath sabka vikas,\" Mr Adityanath declared soon after he was announced the Chief Minister. He has been winning the Gorakhpur seat since 1998 and is the head priest of Gorakhpur Math. The politician-priest with his shaven head and trademark saffron robe has been the party's Hindutva mascot and consistently commissions headlines, usually because of his controversial statements.

      "Yogi Adityanath may not be a monk who sold his Ferrari, but in picking him for the post of Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have certainly sold us a Hindutva dummy in the name of \"vikas\". There are no two ways of saying the obvious truth. Installing such a divisive and thuggish figure at the helm of India's most populous and volatile state is a terrible, terrible decision. Yogi Adityanath (centre) with BJP leaders Anupriya Patel, KP Muriya and Dinesh Sharma. PTI \n",
      "It at once calls into question BJP's highfalutin \"development\" agenda and raises doubts over the genuineness of the prime minister's assertion when he spoke passionately about a new inclusive India during his victory speech post the UP elections. Speaking to BJP leaders and workers in New Delhi, Modi had pledged that his government is \"of those who voted for it, and also those who have not; of those who have walked along, and of those who have not\", urging everyone to join in the making of a new India. \n",
      "It is difficult to see how he plans to achieve this goal by giving the UP CM's chair to a bigoted Hindutva hardliner who has made a career out of inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric. This isn't just legitimising the loony Right, but also telling Muslims that they are unwelcome in a state where they form nearly 20 percent of the population. \n",
      "The brazenness of the move is breathtaking. It tells us several things at once and each of these conclusions make Modi appear weak and ineffectual at best and a mastermind of cynical agenda at worst. \n",
      "Attempt at Hindu consolidation \n",
      "The 2017 UP mandate was path-breaking for BJP for several reasons. It was fought exclusively as a referendum on Modi and the thumping win reflected the fact that a young electorate feels hopeful of a better future under him. The scale and sweep of BJP's win also suggested that a number of Muslim youths and women had favoured the party, in an endorsement of its development agenda and socially progressive stance on issues such as triple talaq. \n",
      "Handing the reins of Uttar Pradesh to the Mahant of Goraknath Mutt, the founder of Right-wing organisation Hindu Yuva Vahini, is an indication that BJP is going for broke in 2019 as far as consolidation of Hindu votes is concerned. It could be a reactionary move to counter opposition parties ganging up against BJP based on a calculation that polarisation will automatically hand BJP unbeatable numbers because the majority will be with it. If this is indeed the reason, then it makes Modi look insecure — as someone who has no faith in development and growth being the platform for an even larger consolidation. \n",
      "Did Yogi muscle his way through? \n",
      "A more likely explanation is that Modi was compelled to install the five-time Gorakhpur MP at helm of UP because he was by far BJP's tallest leader in the state and the party's organisational structure stood at risk being sabotaged if Yogi was ignored. It is being said that the 44-year-old who has several criminal cases against him — including rioting and attempt to murder — commands a large and devoted army of followers who could have jeopardised BJP's chances in 2019 having played a big role in the party's win this year. \n",
      "Did the prime minister blink in the face of Yogi's show of strength? After all, he is said to be backed fiercely by a huge number of MLAs. The scenes of delirium on display on Saturday when his name was eventually disclosed did indicate that his loyal army would have settled for nothing less. \n",
      "Did this groundswell tilt the balance in Yogi's favour compared to more low-key but accomplished performers like Manoj Sinha? If true, this also projects Modi as a weak leader. He had an overwhelming mandate to play around with and no amount of strong-arm tactics should matter. On the other hand, selecting the rabid Hindutva hardliner is a hugely risky proposition because any wrong moves from his part would take away from the prime minister's political capital. \n",
      "Did mandate give rise to arrogance? \n",
      "It is instructive that not once during the entire exhaustive campaign was Yogi's name projected as a prospective CM candidate. This, despite all opinion polls showing him to be BJP's most popular leader in state. It was perhaps an indication that BJP recognised that the Mahant's polarising image was in direct contradiction with its inclusive plank. If the BJP had to make him the CM, why did it not let him spearhead the campaign? And because it had not, making him chief minister now is an insult to the sweeping mandate and belies a brazenness that Modi had warned the party against during his speech. Was he not serious then? \n",
      "Make the worst boy the class monitor? \n",
      "The most charitable explanation, however, is that responsibility will change the mercurial leader and bestow upon him the principles of raj dharma. Yogi, for all his courting of controversies, enjoys a clean, graft-free image and is known to be strict against corruption. His being at the helm will also take care of the bewildering caste equations. Maybe Modi did not feel comfortable in ignoring the choice of party MLAs, but was also careful in appointing two deputy CMs to ensure that Yogi remains within the parameters of development agenda. Venkaiah Naidu was certainly at pains to reiterate that it will be the sole motto of UP government. \n",
      "Whatever be the reason behind Modi and Shah's choice, there is not a shadow of doubt that this controversial decision could have been avoided in favour of a more inclusive candidate. BJP certainly didn't lack talent in its ranks. But, in one stroke, Modi has given legitimacy and a full-time job to conspiracy theorists among opposition and media. Expect mayhem. \n",

Their grouse: revenge for the disrespect BJP showed to Yogi by denying him space in the party’s national executive for the 2017 elections.

With Adityanath as the CM, the saffron party has also announced Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya as the Deputy Chief Ministers of the state. \n",

      "In the run up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party was hunting for a huge open area for their prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, who was drawing huge crowds. \n",
      "The area they zeroed in, near Maanvela village in Gorakhpur, had a high Muslim population. Much to the surprise of the party leadership, the Muslims themselves came forward and offered their agriculture land for Modi’s rally, who till then carried the Godhra taint. \n",
      "The reason: Mahant Yogi Adityanath had helped the Muslims of the area get their dues for the land acquired by the Gorakhpur Development Authority. \n",
      "Now, when the BJP brass rewarded him for the 175 rallies he held across the state, paving the way for the party’s spectacular win in the 2017 elections, eyebrows are being raised. \n",
      "The doubts are no less amplified by the fact that in him, the state will have its first chief minister dressed in saffron, who is mahant of the much-revered Gorakhnath Peeth and has been at the forefront of the Ram temple movement. \n",
      "Adityanath is the second chief minister to come from the Gorakhpur region, a neglected area of the state. Late Vir Bahadur Singh was the first chief minister from the region in a Congress dispensation. \n",
      "Through Adityanath’s selection, the party high command has sent a clear message to the voters about its ambitious plan to pursue their winning formula of Hindutva and development. Simultaneously, the social engineering formula, evolved by the party president Amit Shah, has also been carried forward. Adityanath is a Thakur, while his deputies Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma belong to the OBC and Brahmin community respectively. \n",
      "Many insiders indicate the party’s plan to prop up another Thakur leader against Rajnath Singh, the only Rajput leader of prominence in the state and country. \n",
      "Many political experts define Adityanath as the Modi of Uttar Pradesh. The slogans raised today were ‘ Modi, Modi, Yogi, Yogi’. \n",
      "Political analyst Prof Rajesh Singh said, ” He is hardworking, honest and accessible. His predecessors – Digvijay Nathji and Avaidnathji – never visited a cremation ground, but he attends all functions, including those of birth and death.” Prof Singh, however, cautions that the new chief minister will be able to provide good governance if “he can control his tongue and tone down his belligerence”. \n",
      "Ironically, the public image of the 44-year-old Yogi is his strength as well as his weakness. He is a man of integrity with no corruption charges against him. But he is also a polarising figure. \n",
      "He often allays Muslim fears with remarks like, “I am not against Muslims but against their appeasement.” However, this is not enough for him to win the confidence of 19% Muslims, who are not obliged as the Muslims of Maanvela village in Gorakhpur. \n",
      "None of his public speeches would end without reiteration of his resolve to construct Ram Mandir at the disputed site in Ayodhya and demand strict ban on cow slaughter. His favourite slogan being, ‘Hindutva and Bhautik Vikas’ (Hindutva and physical development). \n",
      "Read | Adityanath’s elevation as UP CM evokes sharp reactions from Opposition \n",
      "The challenges before him will be huge and manifold. \n",
      "He will have to keep the fundamentalist elements in the party in check, win over the Muslims and ensure development of the state. \n",

March 19, 2017 08:33 IST Yogi Adityanath [in saffron] reacts after being elected chief minister of Uttar Pradesh on Saturday, March 18. Twitter/BJP Uttar Pradesh \n",
      "The BJP has chosen firebrand Hindutva leader Yogi Adityanath as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, where it had won the Assembly elections by a sizeable margin. And the reactions and assumptions are coming thick and fast about what will happen in the politically important and often-polarised state now. \n",

      "Here are five things that are bound to happen in UP as Yogi Adityanath takes oath along with his Cabinet of ministers on Sunday, March 19. \n",
      "1. Beef ban: Like it or not, Uttar Pradesh is staring at an impending beef ban. Yogi Adityanath is a cow conservationist, and will be more than happy to impose a ban on beef, cow slaughter and anything on those lines in the state. Such bans are already in place in Maharashtra and Haryana, both of which are ruled by the BJP and headed by chief ministers who have connections to the RSS. \n",
      "2. More ta lk , and construction, of Ram Temple: The Ram Temple has been a poll issue for a long time, and is expected to rear its ugly head again as Yogi Adityanath orders its construction. Of course, there will be some build-up to it: The state government will first order construction, then someone will challenge the order in court, then the issue will be taken up by the Opposition both in the state and in Parliament, and finally construction will start in Ayodhya amid all the chaos. \n",
      "3. Reiteration of his controversial remarks: Yogi Adityanath is a vocal leader, and whenever he has spoken his mind, there has been controversy. From his remarks blaming Muslims for communal riots to those expressing a desire to put idols of Lord Ganesh in mosques, the head priest of the Gorakhnath Temple in Gorakhpur is a veteran when it comes to creating controversies. He will make some more of these remarks, and give the Opposition some more fuel to attack the BJP at the state and national levels. \n",
      "4. Continued public and political outrage: While calls for award waapsi – the returning of government honours in protest against its actions – have already started surfacing, one can safely say that the public outrage that had begun will not end anytime soon. As Yogi Adityanath continues to make controversial statements, the reactions will come thick and fast. \n",
      "5. More Vin Diesel and other memes: Social media – for the most part – is polarised over the choice of Yogi Adityanath as UP chief minister. Some are vaunting it, while others are all but flaying the BJP for the choice. And then there are those who are comparing him to actor Vin Diesel because they look somewhat similar. These memes will continue, at least for some time. Meanwhile, others like rapper Macklemore are also entering the comparison. Here's predicting that other follically-challenged or head-shaven celebrities – like Sir Patrick Stewart and Jay Z – will soon rub shoulders with Yogi Adityanath in memes. Related \n",

Mahana, who currently represents Maharajganj, was urban development minister during the Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh’s regimes.\n",
      "“Other than his experience and seniority, his caste also works in favour of him. He is a Khatri. Due to lack of numerical strength in the state, Khatris are not powerful and therefore no other caste leader would have a problem with him,” a senior leader said. Primarily, Mahana is close to finance minister Arun Jaitley. In fact, Jaitley during his trips to Kanpur always stays at Mahana’s residence. Mahana, however, has vigilance cases pending against him from the time he was a minister. Home Minister Rajnath Singh has completely overruled returning to the state as chief minister. In case of a fractured mandate, Singh would have been crucial in forming the government. But with a clean majority, the choice entirely rests with party leadership.

      "Yogi Adityanath to take oath as UP CM today   09:30   File Photo Lucknow: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Yogi Adityanath will be sworn-in as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh today, as governor Ram Naik will administer the oath of office and secrecy to Adityanath and his Cabinet at a function in Lucknow's Kanshiram memorial ground in the afternoon. State BJP President Keshav Prasad Maurya and the party's National Vice-President Dinesh Sharma will be the Deputy Chief Ministers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Party President Amit Shah and Chief Ministers of NDA-ruled States will attend the ceremony. Yogi Aditya Nath, a five-time Lok Sabha MP from Gorakhpur, was unanimously elected BJP Legislature Party leader at a meeting of the newly-elected MLAs in Lucknow last evening. He, later, met the Governor and staked claim to form the government in the state. Talking to reporters at Raj Bhavan, he said, he would follow Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan 'Sab ka saath, Sab ka vikas' and ensure all round development of the state. Senior party leader and Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, who was the central observer at the Legislature Party meeting, said it was a watershed moment for the BJP and it has become a common man's party. He said, the mandate is for development, and against corruption and black money. In the recently held polls in the state, BJP had bagged 312 seats, and its allies 13, taking the alliance's tally to 325 in the 403-member Assembly. Meanwhile, Adityanath has called on his followers and admirers to maintain law and order during their celebrations, while giving full freedom to the state police to take action on those who create ruckus. \"There should be no chaos in the name of celebrations. Police must deal swiftly and firmly with miscreants,\" he said. Following the Chief Minister designate's orders, all the District Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) have been called to ensure law and order is maintained.\n",

(PTI) As after much speculations, the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) declares Yogi Adityanath as the next Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, questions arise on whether the accession of Adityanath will strengthen the party’s Hindutva establishment in the state.

      "Adityanath is known for some major controversies and some derogatory remarks on various sensitive issues related to caste and religion. In 2005, Adityanath allegedly led a purification move which involved the conversion of Christians to Hinduism. In one such instance, 1,800 Christians were reportedly converted to Hinduism in the town of Etah in Uttar Pradesh during this time. In January 2007, an altercation occurred amidst a Hindu group and Muslims during a Muharram procession in Gorakhpur which led to the hospitalisation of a young Hindu, Raj Kumar Agrahari. The District Magistrate later restricted Adityanath to visit the site as it may inflame tensions. A curfew was implemented by the local police, but Adityanath broke it and was subsequently jailed under Section 151A, Sections 146, 147, 279, 506 of the Indian Penal Code.\n",

      "The message from the BJP is blunt: It need not be apologetic about its core beliefs. Popular mandate provides the stamp of legitimacy to what it holds dear to its heart. The secular liberals and the ideological fence-sitters can go to hell. \n",
      "The selection of Yogi Adityanath as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh is the boldest political-ideological move of the BJP ever since Narendra Modi assumed power as prime minister. That he is controversial as a political figure is an understatement. That he is as close to the Hindutva hard line as possible needs no overstating either. For the first time, it is clear that the BJP is not being surreptitious about its ideological agenda. If it is branded as a hard core Hindutva party, so be it. No apologies required. Yogi Adityanath. PTI \n",
      "The choice of chief ministers in other states such as Haryana was a bit defensive. The chosen ones had the Sangh Parivar grooming alright but they were not combative anti-secularist as Yogi is. He is not at all ambiguous about his opinion of Muslims and nationalism and he is unabashed in his assertiveness. The BJP choosing him as the helmsman of the biggest state in the country cannot be without a purpose. \n",
      "To view it as a strategic move before the 2019 elections may not be correct. The logic that this view revolves around is that some sort of Hindu consolidation has already taken place in the state and someone like Adityanath will take the process forward. But the counter to this logic could be that with the kind of a brute mandate, any other choice would have sufficed. The likes of Rajnath Singh, Manoj Sinha and Keshav Prasad Maurya are identified with the party's ideology and the presence of any of them at the helm would have served the purpose. If there's a Hindu consolidation in favour of the party, it could not have dispersed under them. \n",
      "Then why Yogi Adityanath? Well, it could be that the party wants to take its Hindutva agenda forward. It is confident that it can accommodate it with its development agenda without a conflict. This could have come from the renewed confidence from the mandate in the state where it mixed Hindu polarisation and issues of development with ease. The results told it that it can take along both. This could be the party's template for all future elections in states across the country. \n",
      "It is a resounding slap on the politics around secularism. But nobody should shed tears over this. In a way, the political parties who had reduced secularism to appeasement of certain communities have been shown their place. Their politics also reflected some disdain for the majority sentiment, which is not necessarily anti-secular but tired of the hypocrisy and perversion surrounding the idea of secularism as it is put into practice in electoral politics. \n",
      "Yogi Adityanath could prove to be a disaster or a success, depending on how he approaches the question of secularism. If he is too aggressive in his approach, he might end up alienating a majority of Hindu voters. There's a possibility that his brand of Hindutva might encourage action against liberal Hindus who have voted the BJP on its promise of good governance and development. This would be counterproductive for the party, both in the short and long runs. If he comes across as a sober, purposeful leader, he might win friends among the Muslims too. Whatever the case, the BJP has made its boldest ideological statement by elevating the six-time MP as chief minister. The way he governs the state will decide whether it is a good move. \n",

      "Ever since BJP's stellar performance at the UP elections, there have been loud noises from various political leaders who were literally wiped out, about the fairness of the outcome, especially the tamperproof quality  of the EVMs. They simple could not digest the fact that Modi & Co could get such overwhelming support from all sections of the society cutting across caste and religion divide. In a classic case of sour grape syndrome, few leaders questioned how come Muslims or a particular caste block could have voted for the BJP given its track record? They forget that in politics there are no permanent friends and enemies; only interests are. Had the outcome been different then the same sour grape leaders would have thanked the electorate and praised them for their maturity and intelligence. The EVM machines would have been the perfect ones. But that did not happen and now every defeated party leaders are sulking. Some even have questioned the integrity of Election Commission which is known world over for its professional conduct and impartiality, given the great challenges that arise when conducting polls in a huge country like ours. Some armchair leaders and academics say, hold on.. BJP hardly won 40% of popular votes..hence the party is rejected by the majority. But alas! our electoral system does not work that way. A party need not get absolute majority of popular votes to get absolute majority in assembly or parliament. The largest landslide victory of Late Rajiv Gandhi in 1984 meant only 50% popular vote. By the earlier logic Rajiv also did not have absolute mandate. Many intellectuals as well as ideologically opposing parties to BJP have the habit of constantly shifting the goal post to criticize the party because they can not digest the fact that people of the state / country have elected BJP to rule for five years in a fairly conducted election. \n",
      "To add salt to the injury, now that Yogi Adityanath has been nominated the CM, entire opposition and most of the media commentators and intellectuals are challenging it. How come a man with extreme right wing ideology could become the CM of a state like UP? They forget that the Yogi is a 5 time MP from Gorakhpur. Notwithstanding the alleged cases against the Yogi, he has fought elections and won popular mandate of people. All those opposing him could have used all their political and legal might to put the man behind bars by approaching various courts of the land. If a man is qualified to be a member of parliament of the country, surely he is qualified to become a CM of the state of the federation/ It is BJP's prerogative (the elected legislatures of BJP to be precise) to nominate / elect its leader and forward his/ her name for the CM's post. In any case we can not prejudge the man only based on his antecedents. May be he will prove to be a good administrator for UP. After all unlike many other parties this is not going to be one man rule. There is a state and central team to guide the Yogi and back him up with necessary support. After all my understanding is that Modi will not let his hard earned image of development mascot, undermined by a state CM of his party and thus would keep a close watch on the governance in UP. \n",
      "The transition from Goarkhpur to Lucknow via New Delhi is a hard earned one and outcome of a democratic process. We may criticize Modi, BJP, Hindutva but let us respect the mandate of people of India's largest state. \n",

      "Adityanath's selection as UP CM brings to the fore faultlines in BJP-RSS ties \n",
      "The last-minute choice of Yogi Adityanath, after hectic parleys for a week in Delhi and Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, where the RSS national conclave is set to begin on Sunday, is seen in UP political circles as the resurfacing of differences between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS). \n",
      "Frustration and dissatisfaction loomed large on the faces of party MLAs when they came out of Lok Bhawan, the new Secretariat of the 32nd Chief Minister, after the BJP legislature party meeting on Saturday evening. \n",
      "While the media was agog with speculation that Manoj Sinha, Union Minister of State for Railways, reportedly the choice of Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah, would become the chief minister after 14 years of party 'vanvaas' in UP, temperature suddenly soared at the party headquarters in Lucknow when Adityanath and Maurya were called to Delhi. \n",
      "After meeting Shah, both Adityanath and Maurya returned from New Delhi late afternoon. They separately met Naidu at the VVIP Guest House and then moved to Lok Bhawan to attend the legislature party meeting. \"The meeting was just a formality to endorse their names, which were already decided by the party high command,\" claimed another MLA. \n",
      "The question doing the rounds in Lucknow is that after winning with such a huge mandate, how did Modi and Shah succumbed to the Sangh Parivar's pressure? The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) had already declared Adityanath as the choice of the saffron outfits. Observers claim that the last-minute choice of Adityanath seems to have affected Modi's position within the saffron brigade. \n",
      "They also suggest that it may imply that after getting a huge mandate, the BJP seems to be planning to come back to its aggressive Hindutva and Ram temple agenda in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. \"It is too early to predict but Adityanath's election or rather nomination is a pointer to this assertion,\" points RM Lal, a senior journalist. \n",
      "Those who know the new chief minister well fear that once at the helm of power, he is going to be unstoppable. It is that fear which led the party high command to appoint two deputy chief ministers to keep the hardliner under control. Yogi's appointment seems to have made hollow the party's poll promise 'sabka saath sabka vikas' as minority community leaders have taken this decision with a pinch of salt. \n",
      "\"How will we live without fear and expect that the new government will carry out development for the community members when its head is a man who has been openly advocating declaration of India as a Hindu Rashtra and has been spitting venom against the minority community in almost all his public meetings?\" fumes Mohammed Usman, an influential community leader from old Lucknow. \n",
      "Adityanath was also one of the main accused in 2007 riots in Gorakhpur and neighbouring towns. \n",

      "New Delhi: As Hindutva hardliner Yogi Adityanath was set to assume the reins of Uttar Pradesh, Congress leader Veerappa Moily called it the \"biggest assault\" on secularism, but the party's official reaction was tempered with caution, saying it will act as \"watchdog of people's interest\". \n",
      "The BJP, however, stood behind Yogi, notwithstanding his strident pro-Hindutva credentials, insisting he stands for development. File image of Yogi Adityanath. Image courtesy: CNN-News18 \n",
      "\"It is a big assault on secularism in the country. Maybe the BJP or RSS would like to endorse their cause of Hinduism. India is not Hinduism. Hinduism is not India. India is built above castes and religions and 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (the world is one family) is the very foundation of our secular society. It is the biggest assault ever done on secularism,\" Moily said. \n",
      "Congress in-charge of communications Randeep Surjewala said, \"Congress will continue to act as watchdog of people's interests and play a constructive role in progress of the state of UP.\" \n",
      "Maintaining that the prerogative of choosing a chief minister rested with the ruling party, Surjewala said, \"Excessive delay in arriving at a decision as also the compulsion to create two posts of Deputy CMs reflects a bitter conflict to share spoils of power despite overwhelming majority of over 300 MLA's.\" \n",
      "Notwithstanding the Hindutva rabble rouser image of the 44-year-old five-time MP from Gorakhpur, BJP spokesman Siddharth Nath Singh said, \"That image may be with media but he has been elected again and again. He stands for development and that is the agenda we have got and we will will stick to the agenda.\" \n",

      "Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the lone Muslim minister in the Narendra Modi government, defended BJP's choice of Adityanath, saying he will work for the party's \"inclusive growth\" agenda. \"I congratulate him. He has been in public life for a long time. He will realise the prime minister's commitment of inclusive growth in Uttar Pradesh. Definitely, he will prove to be the best chief minister of the state,\" Naqvi told PTI . \n",
      "Rejecting suggestions that he was a Hindu hardliner, Naqvi said Adityanath was a \"hardline leader of inclusive development\" who will prove political pundits and analysts who have apprehensions about him \"wrong\". \n",
      "Samajwadi Party MP Naresh Agrawal reacted cautiously to Yogi's elevation. \"I congratulate him on his election. We will wait and watch for six months. We hope he will change his thinking and desist from creating a divide between Hindus and Muslims. If he does, we will go among the people and oppose him,\" he said. \n",
      "CPI-M's Brinda Karat termed Adityanath's election as part of \"RSS agenda\". \"It is clearly the RSS agenda and UP is the new experimental field for it. Since it is the victory of RSS (in UP elections), it has chosen the CM. This gentleman has a criminal record. Several charges like rioting and more serious offences are against him in various courts in UP. That's the issue. Then why this rhetoric of ending criminalisation,\" she said, apparently referring to the BJP's criticism of the previous Samajwadi Party government over alleged poor law and order. \n",

However, the meet was not attended by either PM Narendra Modi nor party President Amit Shah . What was likely to transpire was hinted at by a huge number of his supporters gathered outside the building where the meeting was being held as they were the most dominant of the lot and all of them were shouting ‘Yogi, Yogi, Yogi’ drowning out any other rivals supporters’ efforts to shout them down.\n",

And what does Yogi bring to the table? Yogi is a gung-ho can-do strongman who brooks no interference in his work and has an ostensible Hindutva/saffron agenda. Not only will he be looked to provide the muscle-power required to spread the BJP’s support across all regions, he will be expected to keep alive or even power-up the Ayodhya and Ram temple agenda.\n",

      "The swearing-in ceremony will take place on Sunday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah in attendance. (PTI) Yogi Adityanath, the controversial mascot of hardline Hindutva, will be the next chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. In a move that surprised many, the 44-year-old five-term MP from Gorakhpur was elected the BJP legislature party leader at a meeting of the newly-elected MLAs, a week after BJP won a resounding three-fourth majority in the key Hindi heartland state, making a comeback to power after 15 years.\n",
      "State BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya, who was himself in contention for the top job, first announced Adityanath’s election. Maurya, the MP from Phulpur in Allahabad, will be the deputy chief minister, apart from senior BJP leader and Lucknow mayor Dinesh Sharma.\n",
      "The swearing-in ceremony will take place on Sunday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah in attendance.\n",
      "Addressing a press conference after the meeting, Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu, who, along with BJP general secretary Bhupendra Yadav, was present at the meeting as central observer for the election, said Adityanath’s name was proposed by Suresh Khanna, an eight-term MLA, and seconded by 10 others. Naidu said even after the proposal was made, he asked the 312 newly-elected MLAs if they wanted to propose anybody else for the post, but they\n",
      "all backed Adityanath unanimously.\n",
      "Naidu said that the Yogi then said he needed two deputy CMs to assist him in the gigantic task, following which it was decided that Maurya and Sharma would hold the posts. As the meeting was about to begin, an element of surprise gripped the venue when Adityanath reached Lok Bhawan opposite the imposing Assembly complex. Midway through the meeting, Sharma was asked to attend the deliberations.\n",
      "The 45-year-old Yogi, who is a five-time MP from Gorakhpur, is the fourth chief minister of UP having roots in Uttarakhand, after first chief minister of UP Govind Vallab Pant, ND Tiwari and Hemvanti Nandan Bahuguna. The elevation of Yogi Adityanath, who has been a controversial figure due to his staunch Hindutva stance, can strengthen BJP’s ‘Hindutva’ establishment in the state, but might provide enough fodder to the opposition to attack the saffron party for ‘divisive politics’. The appointment comes after a week-long tussle in which many names were doing the rounds, including that of Union ministers Rajnath Singh , Manoj Sinha and state BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya, among others.\n",
      "On naming Yogi as chief minister, the BJP is not only trying to portray him as the mascot of the party’s agenda of development, but has also balanced the tricky caste equation in the state. While Yogi belongs to the Rajput community, Dinesh Sharma belongs to the upper caste, while Keshav Prasad Maurya hails from the OBC community. Sources in the BJP said Yogi’s selection is also seen as Prime Minister Modi’s thrust to the Poorvanchal region of eastern UP. The deprived region is acutely backward and it is here that the BJP’s development challenge will have to be met first. In that sense, the elevation of Yogi has definitely given reason for Poorvanchal to smile.\n",

CM By PANKAJ VOHRA | New Delhi | 19 March, 2017 Tweet The new CM will have two deputies: state BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, currently Mayor of Lucknow and vice president of party. Accepting the wishes of the overwhelming majority of BJP legislators in Uttar Pradesh, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s top leadership declared controversial Hindu leader Yogi Adityanath as the next Chief Minister of the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who spearheaded the campaign, gave his consent to the Yogi’s name after also reaching an understanding with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. \n",
      "The announcement is being seen as a clear reiteration of the BJP’s commitment to Hindutva. The firebrand five-time Member of Parliament from Gorakhpur, Yogi Adityanath has a huge following in the country’s most populous state, cutting across castes. He is a Rajput and originally hails from Garhwal in Uttarakhand. However, his emergence on the state scene has largely been because of his heading the Gorakhnath temple Mutt. \n",
      "The RSS, which at one point was rooting for someone more seasoned with wider acceptability and administrative acumen, agreed to Modi’s proposal, clearing the decks for Adityanath’s appointment. The new CM will have two deputies—state BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya, an OBC, and Dinesh Sharma, a Brahmin, currently Mayor of Lucknow and vice president of the party. The new UP team is light on ministerial experience and thus would bank heavily on advice from New Delhi, as well as from senior leaders to run government. Adityanath is perceived to be the symbol of Hindutva forces and many of his rivals accuse him of being a leader with a medieval outlook. \n",
      "His appointment is likely to be well received by the vast number of the electorate that supported the BJP in the recently concluded Assembly polls. He is expected to help the party fulfil its promise of construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya. However, the Yogi will need to use all the resources at his command to carry various sections of people. After Uma Bharti, who had led the BJP to a spectacular victory in Madhya Pradesh in 2003 and was elected Chief Minister, Adityanath is only the second religious leader to be elevated to the coveted post. \n",
      "Adityanath’s appointment will necessitate a byelection in Gorakhpur, which could perhaps see the coming together of the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress on the same platform to take on the BJP by fielding a common candidate. After Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh, Biren Singh in Manipur and Trivendra Singh Rawat in Uttarakhand, Yogi Adityanath will be the fourth Rajput Chief Minister of a BJP ruled state. Before his appointment, there was intense speculation regarding the post going to an OBC, given that OBCs had voted for the BJP in a big way in the Assembly elections. \n",
      "The choice of the CM was delayed because of hectic parleys within the Sangh Parivar, where, at one stage, a section of the RSS wanted to install Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh to the august office. The move received a setback when Modi hand-picked Trivendra Singh Rawat to assume the charge as the head of government in adjoining Uttarakhand. It was believed that the BJP would not have two Rajputs in adjoining states and it would be politically risky to get someone from the upper castes to be at the helm of affairs. However, pressure from the newly elected MLAs made them reconsider the decision and declare Adityanath as the CM designate. \n",
      "On his part, Rajnath Singh had publicly announced that he was comfortable to be in Delhi, as he had earlier discharged a stint at Lucknow. Nevertheless, a section in the RSS was of the view that securing a seasoned and accomplished person like Rajnath Singh to lead UP would help in consolidating the party’s position. \n",
      "According to sources, a recommendation to appoint Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi to head the government was turned down by the Prime Minister, though several of his admirers in political circles considered this possible move to be a “masterstroke” internationally. It would have also silenced his critics who have spared no effort to project the PM as anti Muslim. But Modi decided to go by the wishes of the MLAs. \n",
      "The Sangh and the BJP leadership are well aware that the massive mandate in UP has raised the expectations of people and no matter what, it had to deliver on all pre-poll pledges. The outcome of the Assembly elections, following the huge win for the party in the 2014 Parliamentary elections, would also provide a boost to the relentless demand for the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya. The overwhelming support the party has received in the state in two successive elections thus would boomerang if in the event the BJP is unable to fulfil the promise of Ram Temple. Thus, it is only a matter of time when the BJP unveils its plans for finding an amicable solution to the Ayodhya issue and furnishes a concrete blueprint for the construction of the temple.

      "How the BJP’s Yogi Adityanath hopes to use religious polarisation to trump caste fragmentation in the battle for Uttar Pradesh. Yogi Adityanath. Credit: PTI \n",
      "This article was first published in April 2014 \n",
      "From 8 am to 10 am each morning, Yogi Adityanath, high priest of the Gorakhnath mandir and Gorakhpur’s Member of Parliament from the Bharatiya Janata Party since 1998, tends to his constituency from a low desk in a spacious room in the administrative block of the temple’s sprawling lands. \n",
      "Assisting him is a team of scribes, seated cross-legged on the ground before a set of ancient Devnagari-script typewriters, balanced on bricks wrapped in old newspaper. Petitioners pass through a security check, leave their shoes at the gate, and approach the priest with folded hands and bowed heads. \n",
      "Adityanath – short, stocky, and clad in saffron robes, thick transparent plastic earrings, and vermillion socks – listens with the fragile patience of a self-consciously busy man. “Write an application,” he occasionally declares. The clerks nod dutifully and slide another sheet of paper into the typewriter. \n",
      "Recent reports describe Adityanath – a Hindutva hardliner, and prime accused in Gorakhpur’s 2007 communal riots – as a key coordinator of the BJP’s election strategy for Uttar Pradesh, the state with the most Lok Sabha seats. He first won the Gorakhpur seat when 26-years-old; now 42, he has fashioned himself as the BJP’s most recognised face in east Uttar Pradesh. \n",
      "The BJP has spoken of a wave in favour of their prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, but Lokniti-CSDS post-election surveys over the past 15 years establish that a quarter to a third of the electorate vote on the individual qualities of a candidate rather than the party she represents, suggesting many seats could turn into head-to-head contests between candidates with specific local histories, rather than the competing narratives of Modi and Rahul Gandhi. \n",
      "In 1999, Yogi Adityanath won Gorakhpur by the slimmest of margins – 7,339 votes; 10 years later in 2009, he romped home with a winning margin of 2,20,000 votes. This year, locals are speculating on the winning margin, rather than the possibility of his victory, despite no particular signs of progress in this constituency. \n",
      "Gorakhpur appears a melancholic border town on the Uttar Pradesh-Nepal border, yet to overcome the loss of its fertiliser factory, shuttered in 1990, its sugar mills that collapsed over the next decade, and its children – claimed by the hundreds every year by Japanese encephalitis. Male and female workforce participation is amongst the lowest in the country and a little more than 70 per cent of households still do not have an indoor toilet. \n",
      "Over 15 years, Adityanath, an upper caste Kshatriya, has sunk deep roots in Gorakhpur. His clerks resolve squabbles in city neighbourhoods; his foot soldiers from the Hindu Yuva Vahini have been criticised for engineering riots in the countryside. His inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric has polarised eastern Uttar Pradesh, while his position as the mahant of the Gorakhnath temple lends his pronouncements an air of mystical profundity. \n",
      "This election season, the BJP has publicly focused on the need for good governance and development and steered clear of overt communal and regional propaganda but on the ground, Modi is banking on regional satraps like Adityanath to bring in the votes at all costs. \n",
      "“We solve problems,” said Dwarika Tiwari, Adityanath’s head clerk, gesturing to his typewriter, his telephone, and a stack of tattered notebooks filled with telephone numbers gathered over decades, “We write to the appropriate authorities, we telephone the superintendent of police, we inform the district magistrate and tell him to investigate.” \n",
      "Jung Bahadur, a retired infantryman, has come on behalf of his grandson, “Rajbir, my grandson ran away with a dhobi caste girl. Her parents say she was kidnapped. He is in police detention.” Chandra Prakash Gupta, dismissed from a private distillery eight years ago, has been coming ever since in search of a job. Suresh Sharma, a Gorakhpur resident now employed as an accountant in Chennai, has dropped by to have his photograph taken with the yogi, “I go to the BJP office in Chennai; it is good to have a photo to show them.” \n",
      "No problem is too small for Adityanath’s attention, no trouble too trifling. “We’ll do whatever is needed,” Tiwari said, as he churned out the latest application on official MP letterheads, “This? This one is for someone who urgently needs a train reservation using the MP quota.” \n",
      "An MP is expected to legislate, hold the executive to account and represent the interests of her constituency in Parliament. Adityanath, for his part, has sponsored five Bills – there was one in 2009, asking the Centre to pass a national law banning cow slaughter, another to change the country’s name from “India that is Bharat” to “Bharat that is Hindustan”, and a third banning forced religious conversions. He has also called on the Allahabad High Court to set up a bench in Gorakhpur, and for a uniform civil code. \n",
      "Yet, in their constituencies back home, MPs aren’t judged by House attendance, questions asked, or participation in debates, but on their ability to leverage the state on behalf of their constituents. \n",
      "Most MPs have neither the funds nor staff to implement big-ticket projects that could ensure re-election. \n",
      "For example, a representative can spend Rs 5 crore per year on her constituency under the MP Local Area Development Scheme, which works out to a total of Rs 400 crore a year for Uttar Pradesh’s 80 Lok Sabha members; a minuscule sum compared with the state government’s budgeted expenditure of Rs 221,201 crore for this year. This is where Adityanath’s morning meetings prove crucial. \n",
      "“Voters perceive the role of MPs as that of a problem solver,” said Chakshu Roy of PRS Legislative Research, explaining MPs are often voted for doing everything apart from their constitutionally mandated jobs, “Voter expectations, therefore, align the incentive structure for MPs to address constituency concerns at the cost of their legislative responsibilities.” \n",
      "Further, before selling their message to their electorates, prospective MPs must first convince their own parties of their candidature – this makes the creation of a committed base and local politics even more critical. Rajnath Singh could replace BJP stalwart Lalji Tandon in Lucknow, but no one is likely to replace Adityanath in Gorakhpur. \n",
      "“The public is deeply attached to my name, to my thought process, to me,” said Adityanath in an interview soon after his durbar, “The public wants their elected representative to be in touch with them.” Through his daily hearings, he said, “I have a constant conversation with the public about their personal problems, problems with the administration, problems with a powerful oppressive person. That is why they vote for me.” \n",
      "Yet, any other candidate could arguably set up an equally efficient grievances cell. Adityanath’s biggest asset, his critics said, is an amorphous vigilante army of youth organised as the Hindu Yuva Vahini and tasked with protecting the Hindu faith. Yogi Adityanath (PTI) \n",
      "In 1999, Yogi Adityanath made front-page news as an MP. “BJP out to protect trigger-happy MP” ran the second lead on the March 6 Lucknow edition of The Times of India, detailing an extraordinary story that began as a minor dispute over the fate of a peepul tree in a Muslim graveyard in a faraway village, acquired increasingly communal overtones, and ended with Adityanath desecrating the graveyard and his supporters fatally shooting a 26-year-old policeman in the face. \n",
      "“A pattern emerged,” said Manoj Singh, a senior journalist in Gorakhpur, “Yogiji or his supporters would interfere in a village-level fight between two communities and turn it into a big case of Hinduism under threat.” \n",
      "An anecdotal list of communal incidents compiled by Singh describes the vigilante group’s involvement in at least 18 separate incidents of communal violence since 1999. While the 2007 Gorakhpur riots, in which a Hindu man was killed and hundreds of Muslim shops burnt, were widely reported, the incomprehensible banality of minor incidents makes for more chilling reading. \n",
      "In 2002, for instance, Adityanath and his followers arrived at Gorakhpur’s Turkmanpur locality and escalated a squabble between a Hindu and Muslim over who spat paan on whom into a full-blown communal confrontation in which stones were thrown, a street brawl erupted and the police were called in. \n",
      "Adityanath insists the Yuva Vahini is simply a cultural organisation. “Our philosophy is to live and let live, but if someone puts their hand on our throats, we have the right to remove that hand by force if need be,” he said. \n",
      "Yet, his critics, both inside and outside the BJP, said Adityanath’s vigilante army was set up to build a power base and grassroots network independent of the the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. BJP leaders begged off from commenting on Adityanath or his politics. “To be honest, I don’t have the time,” said Varun Gandhi, the BJP’s other star campaigner in Uttar Pradesh, before hanging up. \n",
      "His critics in the Congress were more forthcoming. \n",
      "“Adityanath is undoubtedly a rabble rouser. His speeches are venomous and vitriolic even in Parliament,” said Jairam Ramesh, the Congress leader who most recently served as the Union minister for rural development, “He is more of a politician than a sanyasi, peddling a very destructive ideology of hate and prejudice.” \n",
      "In the meantime, the Yuva Vahini has expanded its influence across the region and its strategy of casting routine street fights as ideological struggles is paying dividends. \n",
      "Last month in Rasoolpur, a village in Azamgarh constituency, 100 km south of Gorakhpur, a group of Hindu youth decided to build a brick enclosure around a Hindu deity installed under a roadside tree. The Muslims protested, a fight broke out and a young Muslim man was shot. He survived but his friends grabbed Vijay Pratap Yadav, a father of four and the brother of the sarpanch of Rasoolpur, and beat him to death. \n",
      "Days after Yadav’s death, the local representative of the Hindu Vahini contacted his elder brother, Uma Shankar, and asked him to join the vigilantes. “Of course, something will have to be done,” Uma Shankar said in a recent interview at his house, “The Muslims have terrorised us.” \n",
      "Despite the fact that Mulayam Singh Yadav, leader of the Samajwadi Party, will contest from Azamgarh this time, Uma Shankar said the family was switching allegiance from the Samajwadi Party, the party of choice for most Yadavs, to the BJP. \n",
      "“The Samajwadi Party thinks it wins because of the Muslims, so let’s see what happens when the Yadavs leave it,” he said, “I think we will join the Yuva Vahini, and if we do, we will bring another 50 men with us for Yogiji.” \n",

      "Experts can’t decode as to why PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, who fought elections in the name of development, chose Yogi Adityanath – arguably the biggest Hindu hardliner in the state.(Source: IE) The appointment of Yogi Adityanath as the next chief minister of Uttar Pradesh has all the political pundits scratching their heads. Experts can’t decode as to why PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah , who fought elections in the name of development, chose Adityanath – arguably the biggest Hindu hardline leader in the state. Adityanath’s appointment makes sure that state’s Hindutva-brigade will rally behind BJP in Uttar Pradesh, and majoritarianism will help the saffron party retain current clout in the state. On caste lines, the Hindutva poster boy addresses two large communities – Upper Caste Hindus who are likely to be swayed by his background of being the Mahant (Supreme Priest) of Gorakhpur Math, and at the same time he belongs to the Thakur community (Real name: Ajay Singh), representing another big BJP vote bank. With that, Adityanath brings on table the image of a strong, muscular leader who can deal with UP’s law and order situation. Rest, we all have to wait and watch what Adityanath does. But what about ‘Vikaas’ (development)? There are hardly any records available to prove Adityanath is the ideal Vikaas Purush with vision to deliver PM Narendra Modi’s development vows in the state. Many would argue that PM and Amit Shah completely sidelined development for sake of Hindutva with Adityanath’s appointment. Here we make the case as to why two deputy chief ministers – Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya have been foisted on Adityanath – simply stated, to manage development work.\n",
      "Also watch:\n",
      "The two leaders don’t really seem deputies, but co-managers with Adityanath in government. Dinesh Sharma, who brings with him administerial experience as Lucknow mayor and vice-chief Uttar Pradesh BJP Unit, makes a strong case as a crusader and engineer of all development related aspects in the state. The leader, who is also the national vice-president of BJP, is known for his closeness to PM Narendra Modi. Sharma was hand-picked by Modi as in-charge of his home state Gujarat soon after the party’s landslide victory in 2014 Lok Sabha election. The leader also represents the party’s “young upper-caste face” for the state.\n",
      "Also read: Naidu confirms Adityanath as CM; swearing-in at 2:15 pm\n",
      "On the other hand, Keshav Prasad Maurya has already proved his prowess by successfully managing the UP election trail. He, however, wasn’t the only one managing this task. But what may have worked for him was his representation of OBC community which played a major role in BJP’s mammoth victory in state. While Yogi Adityanath is firebrand Hindu leader, Maurya and Sharma have always remained low key in UP politics. One crucial aspects which should be remembered here that Adityanath doesn’t come from a Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh-background. While Maurya and Sharma are both grassroots Sangh workers. Clearly, the state of Uttar Pradesh is heading for rule, not under one, but a collective leadership of three leaders.\n",

      "LUCKNOW/NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah chose saffron hardliner Yogi Adityanath to be the chief minister of UP + in a defiant assertion of their Hindutva nationalist credentials + midway through the term of the NDA regime at the Centre. \n",
      "\n",
      "The controversial five-term MP + from Gorakhpur is known for his polarising rhetoric and belongs to the extreme right, or the \"fringe\" that many warned Modi about and wanted shunned. By picking Adityanath to govern India's largest state, Modi and Shah have sent across a clear message that they will be bound by neither the norms of \"politics as usual\" nor the requirements of political correctness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Coming after the \" surgical strike + \" and demonetisation + , the appointment of Yogi, an unabashed leader of the Ramjanmabhoomi movement, can be termed as the third \"disruptive move\" of the saffron regime, and is part of the populist nationalism BJP seems to be crafting around the theme of Hindutva. \n",
      "\n",
      "Observers promptly saw it as an attempt to consolidate Hindus ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Hindutva themes were part of BJP's successful poll pitch and in fact, Modi himself was accused of polarising the electorate in the runup to the UP polls when he gave the \"shamshan versus kabristan\" analogy to argue that the SP government discriminated among communities. Shah was also accused of seeking to communalise the voters. BJP chief Amit Shah had harped on the promise to shut down mechanised abattoirs and to set up anti-Romeo squads: shorthand for a crackdown on \"love jihad\". \n",
      "\n",
      "But it was part of the larger mix which sought to tap into secular concerns over backwardness, unemployment, alleged collapse of law and order and farm distress besides the state's partisanship towards certain groups. The contentious decision on Saturday brings Hindutva to the fore overshadowing the development agenda and will raise fears of the party pedalling away from its \"Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas\" commitment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yogi acknowledged the concern when talking to reporters after his election as the chief of the BJP parliamentary party and said, \"It is our duty to take UP to new heights of development. I believe in Modiji's ideology of 'sabka saath sabka vikas'.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "He also said he will not tolerate hooliganism in the name of celebrations. The selection will, no doubt, go down extremely well with the party's core base. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yogi was in huge demand across the state during the party's campaign: a refutation of the charge of his detractors in BJP that his appeal is restricted to \"7-8 districts of eastern UP\". \n",
      "\n",
      "According to top party sources, leadership factored in the criticism Yogi's appointment is set to generate. It is, however, confident that the resentment in certain quarters will be more than compensated by the goodwill Yogi, with his tough persona, is expected to generate by setting right the \"law and order\" situation and by ensuring that bureaucracy cooperates in speeding up delivery: something of crucial importance for party's aim to retain a majority of the 73 Lok Sabha seats it bagged in 2014.\n",

      "The sabka saath sabka vikas party has made history in Uttar Pradesh. On Sunday, a Hindu priest, a Rajput and five-time Member of Parliament from Gorakhpur, Yogi Adityanath, will be sworn in as the state’s 32 nd Chief Minister. Yogi Adityanath—anointed Ajay Singh at birth—is a pahadi Rajput. His roots are in Uttarakhand. \n",
      "The Yogi has beaten Home Minister Rajnath Singh, also a Rajput, to the post. Singh was chief minister from 2000-2002 but is not popular as a Rajput leader as such. He had tried to weld together a new, most-backward grouping in UP that had proved abortive. The BJP, on two other occasions, had made OBC leader Kalyan Singh and Ram Prakash Gupta, a bania , the Chief Minister. Advertisement opens in new window \n",
      "By electing Yogi Adityanath the BJP has pandered to the party’s upper caste core vote base—but not because Adityanath has a following among Brahmins or Rajputs either. The party has instead drifted from the development narrative, seeing the scale of its sweep. It has decided to firmly interpret the win as a pro-Hindutva verdict and may try to paper over caste differences with communalism. Nevertheless, there is a deep caste symbolism in this appointment, which will not be lost on the people of UP. \n",
      "Historically the Rajputs have positioned themselves as the great defenders of the Hindu faith. More recently, they have played the role of the musclemen of Hindutva. Yogi Adityanath runs a militaristic vigilante-style Hindu Yuva Vahini , or Hindu Youth Vehicle with thousands of armed volunteers. He thus represents a ‘martial’ caste playing the tune of militant Hinduism. For sure, he is not known for development. \n",
      "How the new UP government will bring together the diverse strands of the state’s population, considering the party’s sweep cuts across caste, age and gender, is anybody’s guess. The big section that didn’t vote for BJP—never mind defensive claims from BJP leaders—is the Muslims. They would view Adityanath as CM in the same light as Hindus would see Azam Khan being put in that post. The OBC assertion and aspiration sparked by the BJP victory would also be drenched by this appointment. Advertisement opens in new window \n",
      "Indeed, the BJP had fielded many a Rajput in the just-concluded UP polls, and they garnered over 50 of the party’s 312 seats. The party may want to acknowledge their contribution by sending up the Yogi to Lucknow. Yet, it is equally true that the BJP fielded around 50 backward caste and 70 Other Backward Caste candidates, Keshav Prasad Maurya in particular. Maurya’s supporters led protests in Lucknow on Saturday, demanding he be made CM. The BJP was being feted for drumming up support from “non-Yadav OBCs”—a purely political term with no basis in the UP caste structure—and yet many had seriously expected an OBC leader would bubble up for this post. \n",
      "The fact is that Yogi Adityanath is a Hindutva rabble-rouser and strongman whose domain was, thus far, limited to his eastern UP stronghold. Seen from a caste angle, perhaps the Home Minister, the other Rajput contendor, would not have wanted to jump into trying and managing this kind of a verdict. \n",
      "The caste extremes that have cast their lot with the BJP are socially and economically not going to prove easy to manage. To send Adityanath to manage these poles is to confirm that the story of UP elections was, ultimately, low-grade but deep-set communal polarization. Advertisement opens in new window \n",
      "The selection of Yogi Adityanath is also a political masterstroke for the BJP. Now, it has the polarisation in western UP to rely on thanks to the Jats, while Rajnath Singh's strong position in central UP upper caste strongholds will hold sway in years to come and eastern UP also falls within the kitty of Hindutva. \n",
      "In the post-1982 scenario, the Congress turned to the Hindu card in UP, with sloganeering to the effect that ‘Hindus cannot be neglected’—implying that they were being ignored. Yogi Adityanath is the next new normal for UP, whether it is minus the camouflage of vikas or plus it, is to be seen. In that context, truth be told, the BJP might well have preferred an OBC CM face instead of Yogi Adityanath—but with the same politics. \n",

      "A confident BJP has decided to put in place a team of 'A' players to head its government in UP. This team is expected to be ruthless in implementing BJP's manifesto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are 3 reasons why the the team of 1 CM and 2 Deputies is a good step forward\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Law & Order - The strength and dose of any medicine has to be proportional to the spread of the disease. Given the rampant lawless and the rise of local bahubalis in the last 5 years, only a strong, no-nonsence leader can deliver on law and order. A leader is needed who can put the fear of the law in the minds of local bahubalis. On this count, there is no better leader than Yogi Adityanath. He will lead the charge to establish the rule of law. Women security will get a boost with Yogi as CM. Yogi's track record as a MP since 1998 has been impressive. His interventions during 55 debates and 200+ questions he put forth during Question Hour demonstrate his administrative and policy making acumen. Yogi is as young as a Kejriwal or Rahul Gandhi but has more political experience than both of them combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Development - Developing a large state like UP is no mean task. The model of having 2 Deputy CM's who have a history of getting projects executed on the ground will accelerate development in a state which has been a laggard in terms of growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Reflection of the mandate - BJP won the mandate on a solid Hindu vote. Hindus came together for the first time since 1991 and voted as one community for one agenda - law & order and development for all. The Tr-Murti model is just a reflection of the mandate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its good to see a confident, non-apologetic government take oath in UP.  Elections are now over, its time to now move to governance.\n",

      "The selection of Yogi Adityanath as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh surprised even ardent fan of BJP. Everyone admits that Yogi commands largest number of pro – Right followers in UP, but his personality was not considered suitable for being at the helm. UP is crucial for Modi, if he wants to retain power in 2019 and hence the selection of Chief Minister had become a matter of great interest. It can be said that Modi as a politician has gone for another master stroke which may help him in the entire Northern Belt of India in 2019 Lok Sabha election. \n",
      "\n",
      "BJP has decided to respect the sentiment of the people rather than following the dictums of media personalities and armchair political analysts. \n",

      "Caste of Yogi Adityanath \n",
      "If you ask any BJP supporters about the caste of Yogi, you are like to get a plain answer that he is the first CASTELESS Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. But, Indian politics in general and UP politics in particular is not so simple. Even if there is overall Hindu consolidation, the caste factor needs to be taken care of. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is also no denying that Thakur in UP has wholeheartedly supported BJP in 2017 Assembly Election. The reason was varied, but the main point was Daya Shankar Singh idiotic statement about Mayawati and heinous crime by BSP supporters against his family. It is because of this fact that many were expecting BJP to name a Thakur as the CM candidate. And, hence, Rajnath Singh was projected to be there. But, Modi – Shah was having different mind. There was also an issue of powerful support for the party by non – Yadav OBC and hence there was demand to give the coveted chair to a person belonging to this group, like Keshav Prasad Maurya. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, it is Yogi Adityanath. Is he casteless? No. Yogi may never say anything about his caste, but he is also colored in a caste goggle. \n",
      "\n",
      "By caste Yogi Adityanath is a Thakur (Rajput). He is basically from Garhwal region of Uttarakhand. His real name is Ajay Singh. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, BJP despite going for a Yogi has kept an eye on the caste factor also and elevated a Thakur as the CM. \n",
      "\n",
      "It should also be noted that there are many reports where Yogi Adityanath is accused of giving free hand to Thakur in Gorakhpur. Majority of hardline members of his Hindu Yuva Vahini are also Thakurs. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be interesting to see whether Yogi Adityanath remained casteless in the public forum or will he decide to identify himself with a caste like Modi who in his later years started to give his identification as an OBC leader. \n",
